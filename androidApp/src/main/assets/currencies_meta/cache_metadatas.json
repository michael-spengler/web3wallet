The idea was to create a stable cryptocurrency that can be used like digital dollars. Coins that serve this purpose of being a stable dollar substitute are called \u201cstable coins.\u201d Tether is the most popular stable coin and even acts as a dollar replacement on many popular exchanges! According to their site, Tether converts cash into digital currency, to anchor or \u201ctether\u201d the value of the coin to the price of national currencies like the US dollar, the Euro, and the Yen. Like other cryptos it uses blockchain. Unlike other cryptos, it is [according to the official Tether site] \u201c100% backed by USD\u201d (USD is held in reserve). The primary use of Tether is that it offers some stability to the otherwise volatile crypto space and offers liquidity to exchanges who can\u2019t deal in dollars and with banks (for example to the sometimes controversial but leading exchange <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/bitfinex\">Bitfinex</a>).\r\n\r\nThe digital coins are issued by a company called Tether Limited that is governed by the laws of the British Virgin Islands, according to the legal part of its website. It is incorporated in Hong Kong. It has emerged that Jan Ludovicus van der Velde is the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, which has been accused of being involved in the price manipulation of bitcoin, as well as tether. Many people trading on exchanges, including Bitfinex, will use tether to buy other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Tether Limited argues that using this method to buy virtual currencies allows users to move fiat in and out of an exchange more quickly and cheaply. Also, exchanges typically have rocky relationships with banks, and using Tether is a way to circumvent that.\r\n\r\nUSDT is fairly simple to use. Once on exchanges like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/poloniex\">Poloniex</a> or Bittrex, it can be used to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It can be easily transferred from an exchange to any Omni Layer enabled wallet. Tether has no transaction fees, although external wallets and exchanges may charge one. In order to convert USDT to USD and vise versa through the Tether.to Platform, users must pay a small fee. Buying and selling Tether for Bitcoin can be done through a variety of exchanges like the ones mentioned previously or through the Tether.to platform, which also allows the conversion between USD to and from your bank account."}, "binancecoin": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/825/large/bnb-icon2_2x.png?1644979850", "rank": 4, "colors": ["#EFB80A", "#F3C73C"], "link": "https://www.binance.com", "description": "Binance Coin is the cryptocurrency of the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance\">Binance</a> platform.

Maker offers a transparent stablecoin system that is fully inspectable on the Ethereum blockchain. Founded almost three years ago, MakerDao is lead by Rune Christensen, its CEO and founder. Maker\u2019s MKR coin is a recent entrant to the market and is not a well known project. However, after today it will be known by many more people after blowing up 40% and it is one of the coins to rise to prominence during the recent peaks and troughs.\r\n\r\nAfter being developed by the MakerDAO team, Maker Dai officially went live on December 18th, 2017. Dai is a price stable coin that is suitable for payments, savings, or collateral and provides cryptocurrency traders with increased options concerning opening and closing positions. Dai lives completely on the blockchain chain with its stability unmediated by the legal system or trusted counterparties and helps facilitate trading while staying entirely in the world of cryptocurrencies. The concept of a stablecoin is fairly straight forward \u2013 it\u2019s a token that has its price or value pegged to a particular fiat currency. A stablecoin is a token (like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>) that exists on a blockchain, but unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, Dai has no volatility.\r\n\r\nMKR is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain and can not be mined. It\u2019s instead created/destroyed in response to DAI price fluctuations in order to keep it hovering around $1 USD. MKR is used to pay transaction fees on the Maker system, and it collateralizes the system. Holding MKR comes with voting rights within Maker\u2019s continuous approval voting system. Bad governance devalues MKR tokens, so MKR holders are incentivized to vote for the good of the entire system. It\u2019s a fully decentralized and democratic structure, then, which is an underutilized USP of blockchain tech.\r\n\r\nValue volatility is a relative concept among both cryptos and fiat currencies. The US dollar, for example, was worth 110.748 yen on July 9, 2018. On July 4, 2011, $1 was worth 80.64 yen, and on March 18, 1985, $1 was worth 255.65 yen. These are major differences in exchange rates, and inflation within each country makes each currency worth different values even when compared to themselves. One USD in 1913 is worth the equivalent of $25.41 today, and even $1 in 1993 is worth the equivalent of $1.74 today. Stablecoins don\u2019t negate these basic economic principles of value. Instead, both Tether and Dai have values pegged to the U.S. dollar. This is done to stabilize the price."}, "arbitrum": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/16547/large/photo_2023-03-29_21.47.00.jpeg?1680097630", "rank": 43, "colors": ["#2A88BC", "#9FC6E2"], "link": "https://arbitrum.io/", "description": "Arbitrum is one of the leading Ethereum scaling solutions bringing cheap transactions to tens of thousands of users in an environment that feels very similar to Ethereum.

Paxos was the first virtual currency company to receive a charter from the New York State Department of Financial Services. As a chartered limited purpose trust company with fiduciary powers under the Banking Law, Paxos is able to offer regulated services in the crypto-asset and virtual commodities space.\r\n\r\nThe Paxos team comes from a wide variety of backgrounds with a diverse array of experiences ranging from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. It\u2019s led by CEO and co-founder Charles Cascarilla, who has spent his career as a customer, analyst, investor and now creator of financial technology.\r\n\r\nPaxos describes itself as \u201cthe first regulated Trust company with blockchain expertise\u201d, and it is using that expertise to create a modern settlement solution that can eliminate risk and simplify settlements. What many people may not know about Paxos is that it was actually founded in 2012 as Paxos Trust Company, and that for most of its life it ran the cryptocurrency exchange itBit, which is still operates. The creation of Paxos was a pivot from an exchange platform to a company focused on creating a modern settlement platform using blockchain technology.\r\n\r\nPaxos has become the most widely adopted cryptocurrency in the fastest time frame, with support from over 20 exchanges and OTC desks in the first five weeks of its existence. It\u2019s been picked up and listed by six of the top ten cryptocurrency exchanges, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance\">Binance</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/okex\">OKEx</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/gate\">Gate.io</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/zb\">ZB</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/kucoin\">KuCoin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/digifinex\">DigiFinex</a>. These exchanges are offering PAX as an alternative to the controversial <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tether\">Tether</a>. Unlike the controversy surrounding the people who control Tether, there is no such obscurity when it comes to the people behind Paxos. The CEO and co-founder is Charles Cascarilla. He has over 15 years in financial services and has co-founded Cedar Hill asset management back in 2005. He has also worked and Bank of America and Goldman Sachs prior to that.\r\n\r\nThe Pax Dollar (USDP) is the first digital asset to be issued by a financial institution and to be fully secured by the U.S. dollar. While other similar stablecoins have existed, there has been no proof of full U.S. dollar reserves, nor have these earlier assets been issued by a financial institution. The Paxos team has been fairly clear in declaring the different base that PAX is working from.

The hope was to bring greater value to Huobi\u2019s millions of users, mostly located in Asian countries. The launch of the Huobi Token follows in the footsteps of other loyalty-building tokens that other exchanges have launched. The first and most successful of these tokens has been <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/binancecoin\">Binance Coin (BNB)</a>. The creation of BNB secured Binance\u2019s place as the world\u2019s leading exchange. It offered discounted trading fees in exchange for customer loyalty, primarily functioning as a loyalty rewards system.\r\n\r\nHuobi officially announced its intentions to launch a new token on January 22, 2018. Over the course of 15 days, Huobi would distribute 300 million HT (60% of the total supply) to its pro users who purchased a discounted service package. Each morning, a new batch of HT would become available on a first come, first served basis. Huobi declared this token distribution scheme, \u201cnot an ICO,\u201d due to the nature of the offering. Users are buying a specific service package, part of which includes HT that give a discount toward trading fees. The exchange launched the Huobi Token as part of an overall strategy to recover its user base after tightening regulations in China severely restricted cryptocurrency trading. In an interview with CoinDesk, Leon Li, Huobi\u2019s founder, revealed that Chinese rule changes had decimated the trading volume on Huobi by 95% between September 15 and November 1, 2017.\r\n\r\nThe HT token distribution began on January 24 and wrapped up on February 7, 2018. Each day of the distribution, millions of tokens sold out in mere minutes after going on sale. At that point, 300 million HT had been distributed to Huobi Pro members who bought packages. That\u2019s 60% of the total supply currently in public circulation. Another 200 million HT, 40% of the total supply, was set aside. 20% goes toward user rewards and platform operation.

The Enjin team is designing the coin completely around gaming with the goal of it being the most usable cryptocurrency for the industry. The project includes the Enjin Coin as well as a suite of software development kits (SDKs) that developers can integrate into their games and communities. Bringing blockchain to gaming helps to reduce the high fees and fraud that\u2019s prevalent in the transfer of virtual goods.\r\n\r\nEnjin Coin is an ERC20 token built on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> network. With that, the project not only acts as a cryptocurrency but also has smart contract capabilities. It\u2019s also one of the first projects testing the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/raiden-network\">Raiden Network</a>, Ethereum\u2019s version of the Lightning Network. The Enjin Coin platform provides a laundry list of features through its public API and SDKs. To keep things brief, though, we\u2019ll only be discussing a few of the major ones in this article. The largest value Enjin Coin brings to the gaming community is in its creation and management of virtual goods. Developers on each platform can easily create a currency unique to their community that\u2019s backed by Enjin Coin as the parent currency. This gives the coins all the benefits of the blockchain (speed, cost, security, etc\u2026) while still staying customized to their respective platforms.\r\n\r\nEnjin, the company behind Enjin Coin, is the largest online gaming community creation platform. Started in 2009, the company receives 60 million views per month and transacts millions of U.S. dollars each month in their community stores. The team is deploying Enjin Coin across the entire Enjin CMS platform \u2013 over 250,000 gaming websites. Advisors to the project consist of Anthony Diiorio (Ethereum co-founder) and Pat LaBine (previous producer and technical director at Bioware). Enjin has also formed partnerships with Unity, PC Gamer, and NRG eSports. The team held a successful ICO in late 2017 in which they raised ~$35 million between the private and public rounds. Although it\u2019s still a young project, the team spent the last quarter of 2017 building the Platform API, Mobile Smart Wallet, and a Java SDK alongside creating a Minecraft plugin. They\u2019ve got plenty in store for 2018, but the highlights include various platform plugins, the Efinity release, and numerous other SDKs.\r\n\r\nEnjin also features a tool known as TopLists, which allow users to rank games, servers, teams and any other item. TopLists will be deployed as a decentralized smart contract with functionalities that will allow for market bidding or democratic voting. List creators are incentivized to promote and market their list because these creators will receive tokens when users perform tasks such as voting on their list.

The business value of AI is becoming clearer each day; however, there\u2019s a significant gap between the people developing AI tools (researchers and academics) and the businesses that want to use them. Most organizations need a more customized solution than what a single AI project can offer, and research projects oftentimes have trouble accessing a large enough data set to build effective machine learning. SingularityNET closes these gaps.\r\n\r\nThe long-term vision of the SingulairtyNET team is to build a network of complex AI Agent interactions primarily using resources from the OpenCog Foundation. To look at this further, let\u2019s check out their in-house built humanoid robot, Sophia. Sophia uses a combination of AI Agents that range from natural language processing to physical motor controls to operate. You tell Sophia to summarize a video that\u2019s embedded in a webpage. To do this, Sophia sends a request to Agent A. Through its AI, Agent A knows that Agent B specializes in analyzing and transcribing video while Agent C specializes in summarizing text. Agent A pays Agent B and Agent C to perform these tasks while Sophia pays Agent A to coordinate. All the while, each Agent has updated their own AI with the network information gained from these tasks and combines it with their previous experiences and knowledge. Therefore, the collective AI of the system grows at a faster rate than any individual Agent.\r\n\r\nSingularityNET wants to build a decentralized protocol for creators and users of AI to interact with each other, to not only help individual projects benefit by leveraging the strengths of other AI systems that might handle certain tasks better, but ultimately to develop SingularityNET into a functioning AI system itself, with nodes on the network making their own decisions about how to connect services and proactively provide solutions to academic and business problems. Tokenizing the network creates an AI marketplace where AI developers and sellers can not only link with others who might assist in building more robust AI solutions, but also allow AI services and products to be bought and sold, creating revenue and establishing price points where none have existed before.\r\n\r\nThe SingularityNET team boasts 50+ AI developers and 10+ PhDs. Dr. Ben Goertzel leads the group as CEO and Chief Scientist. He\u2019s also the Chairman of the OpenCog Foundation and the Artificial General Intelligence Society, as well as the Chief Scientist at Hanson Robotics, the partner company helping bring SingularityNET to life.

Data is about remembering our lived and shared experiences. Distributing the storage and processing of that data can change how we coordinate and interact. With digital integration under user control, Holochain liberates our online lives from corporate control over our choices and information.\r\n\r\nHolochain is an energy efficient post-blockchain ledger system and decentralized application platform that uses peer-to-peer networking for processing agent centric agreement and consensus systems between users.\r\n\r\nHolochain enables any device to have its own chain based ledger system. By using a holographic model for data storage and transfer developers can now create decentralized applications that can scale in multiple dimensions across a network ensuring they are truly distributed. This enables every device on a network to function independently, and only requires the synchronization of data when necessary, or agreed upon by users. This means every user is in control of their own data, and never has to risk their data being sold or exposed to 3rd parties like what just happened with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.\r\n\r\nHolochain provides a framework for developers to build decentralized applications and aims to change the paradigm of data-centric blockchains to an agent-centric system. In Holochain\u2019s fledgling system, no true global consensus is maintained. Instead, each agent in the public blockchain maintains a private fork, essentially, that is managed and stored in a limited way on the public blockchain with a distributed hash table. This means there are no scalability limits and dapps hosted on Holochain can do much more with less of nearly everything than traditional blockchains.\r\n\r\nThis system however has some inherent weaknesses. Because the entire blockchain must be verified by each member of the network, scalability problems quickly develop. The larger the amount of data being handled, the more restrictive the limit of transactions per second that can occur on the blockchain at any one time.Holochain itself is open source and written in Go. Go was selected for its ease of use and similarity to C.

It utilizes an <a href\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">ethereum</a>-based transaction system to clear payments between providers, requestors and software developers however it is safe because all computations take place in sandbox environments and are fully isolated from the hosts\u2019 systems. \r\n\r\nThe company released Brass in 2016 which includes Blender and LuxRender which are the two tools for CGI rendering. There are three releases that follows which are Clay, Stone and Iron. Golem has recently updated their Brass Beta and the highlight of this upgrade are the streamlined task creation GUI, the support for partial task restart in case of subtask timeouts and the fix that should alleviate the issues with the Docker service on Windows. Other than that, improvements have been made on the Blender verification and transaction tracking subsystems and fixed some minor pain-points in the UX. Transaction history will become more user-friendly with separate tabs for payments and incomes.

By powering decentralized microservices and asynchronous task execution, Golem is set to become a key building block for future Internet service providers and software development. And, by substantially lowering the price of computations, complex applications such as CGI rendering, scientific calculation, and machine learning become more accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\n\u25cf Golem connects computers in a peer-to-peer network, enabling both application owners and individual users (\"requestors\") to rent resources of other users\u2019 (\"providers\") machines. These resources can be used to complete tasks requiring any amount of computation time and capacity.

In addition, Livepeer is meant to provide an economically efficient alternative to centralized broadcasting solutions for any existing broadcaster. In this document we describe the Livepeer Protocol - a delegated stake based protocol for incentivizing participants in a live video broadcast network in a game-theoretically secure way. We present solutions for the scalable verification of decentralized work, as well as the prevention of useless work in an attempt to game the token allocations in an inflationary system.\r\n\r\nThe Livepeer Token (LPT) is the protocol token of the Livepeer network. But it is not the medium of exchange token. Broadcasters use Ethereum's Ether (ETH) to broadcast video on the network. Nodes who contribute processing and bandwidth earn ETH in the form of fees from broadcasters. LPT is a staking token that participants who want to perform work on the network stake in order to coordinate how work gets distributed on the network, and to provide security that the work will get done honestly and correctly. LPT has the following purposes:\r\n\r\nIt serves as a bonding mechanism in a delegated proof of stake system, in which stake is delegated towards transcoders (or validators) who participate in the protocol to transcode video and validate work. The token, and potential slashing that occurs due to protocol violation, is necessary in order to secure the network against a number of attacks. More below.\r\nIt routes work through the network in proportion to the amount of staked and delegated token, essentially serving as a coordination mechanism.\r\n\r\nIt is a unit of account that is specific to the Livepeer ecosystem, which forms the basis of a SectorCoin concept, applicable to additional functionality to be introduced in the future. Services such as DVR, closed captioning, ad insertion/monetization, and analytics can all plug into the Livepeer ecosystem and potentially make use of the security provided by staking LPT.\r\n\r\nAn initial allocation of Livepeer Token will be distributed so that stakeholders can fulfill various roles in, and use the network, and then additional token will be issued according to algorithmically programmed issuance over time.\r\n\r\nFollowing the conventions of Ethereum and many popular ERC20 tokens, LPT will be divisible by 10 ^ 18, with larger denominations such as the LPT itself intended to be used for user level transactions such as staking, and smaller denominations intended to be used for protocol accounting."}, "audius": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12913/large/AudiusCoinLogo_2x.png?1603425727", "rank": 171, "colors": ["#5311B4", "#A721D3"], "link": "https://audius.co/", "description": "AUDIO is the native platform token of the Audius streaming protocol.

Over 200 security tokens have been deployed using their Ethereum-based solution and they are now in the midst of launching Polymesh, an institutional-grade blockchain built specifically for regulated assets. Polymath streamlines antiquated processes and opens the door to new financial instruments by solving the inherent challenges with public infrastructure around identity, compliance, confidentiality, and governance. \r\n\r\nRecognizing that the industry lacked security-specific standards, Polymath spearheaded the creation of a unified standard for security tokens on Ethereum, ERC 1400. ERC 1400 acts as an umbrella of standards and is designed to address some of the challenges in managing security tokens by enabling the ability to conserve UBO rights for custodied assets, and automate transfer control (including KYC verification) and corporate actions (including capital distribution or voting). \r\n\r\nPolymath has brought forward many advanced innovations that address regulatory and market needs head-on. They have built a series of tools on the chain that offer non-technical users an intuitive means to access the chain\u2019s functionality, and are also in the midst of launching Polymesh, an institutional-grade blockchain built for security tokens and the first specialized chain of this nature. Security tokens have the ability to alter the financial landscape, unlocking trillions of dollars in asset value and investment, programmably automating operations, and driving new paths to liquidity - but there are significant barriers standing in the way of institutional adoption. The foundations of Polymesh are focused on the most crucial regulatory elements addressed by four key design principles meant to meet the demands of regulators and institutions. Those four principles are Identity, Compliance, Confidentiality, and Governance. When put together, these four pillars can also support complex operations, such as settlement. \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to creating and managing digital securities, Polymesh\u2019s specificity gives it, and the applications built on it, a distinct advantage over those leveraging general-purpose blockchains. The purpose-built infrastructure addresses the gaps in standard blockchain architecture to align the functioning of the blockchain with the requirements of modern capital markets. By combining Polymesh\u2019s deep functionality with user-friendly tools, Polymath stands to transform capital markets.\r\n\r\nAll transactions on the Polymath platform take place using the native POLY token. POLY is the utility token that fuels Polymath Token Studio on Ethereum and is used by issuers creating and managing security tokens on the platform.

The main goal of Kyber Network is to enable DeFi DApps, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and other users easy access to liquidity pools that provide the best rates.\r\n\r\nAll transactions on Kyber are on-chain, which means they can be easily verified using any Ethereum block explorer. Projects can build on top of Kyber to utilize all the services offered by the protocol, such as the instant settlement of tokens, liquidity aggregation, and a customizable business model.\r\n\r\nKyber looks to solve the liquidity issue in the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry by allowing developers to build products and services without having to worry about liquidity for different needs. \r\n\r\nThe Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) token is a utility token that is the \"glue that connects different stakeholders in Kyber's ecosystem.\" KNC holders can stake their tokens in the KyberDAO to help govern the platform and vote on important proposals \u2014 and earn staking rewards in Ethereum (ETH) that come from trading fees. \r\n\r\nWhat Makes Kyber Network Unique?\r\nKyber Network is the first tool that allows anyone to instantly swap tokens without the need of a third-party, like a centralized exchange. The unique architecture of Kyber is designed to be developer-friendly, which enables the protocol to be easily integrated with apps and other blockchain-based protocols.\r\n\r\nDeFi has many use cases and possibilities. Therefore, no single liquidity protocol can fit the needs of all liquidity providers, takers, and other market participants. Kyber\u2019s liquidity hub architecture allows developers and the Kyber team to rapidly innovate and integrate new protocols into the overall Kyber Network to cater to different liquidity needs.\r\n\r\nIn April 2021, Kyber launched the Kyber DMM, the world\u2019s first dynamic market maker protocol (DMM). Kyber DMM is a next-generation AMM designed to react to market conditions to optimise fees, maximise earnings, and enable extremely high capital efficiency for liquidity providers, especially for stable pairs with low variability in price range (like USDC/USDT, ETH/SETH). They will be able to support pools with extremely high amplification factors, which means given the same liquidity pool and trade size, slippage can be 100x (or more) better than typical AMMs. Depending on their amplification strategy, liquidity providers can maximise the use of their capital and have the opportunity to earn much more fees relative to their contribution size, while takers can enjoy extremely low slippage on their trades.\r\n\r\nKyber DMM is the first of many new liquidity protocols that will be launched on the Kyber 3.0 Liquidity Hub.\r\n\r\nIn the Kyber ecosystem, KNC token holders play an important role in deciding new growth and value-capture opportunities and incentive mechanisms. Through KyberDAO, KNC holders can participate in the governance of the network by voting on important proposals. Kyber\u2019s community is sizable and made up of a wide range of developers, in addition to other members of the blossoming DeFi industry.\r\n\r\nKyber\u2019s fully on-chain design enables the protocol to maintain full transparency and verifiability. The platform claims to be the most used liquidity hub in the world.\r\n\r\nHow Is the Kyber Network Secured?\r\nAs an ERC-20 token, Kyber is built on top of and secured by the Ethereum blockchain. In addition, Kyber uses an extensive trust and security model that protects users from misbehaving administrators or exchanges, thanks to security measures built in both at the protocol and smart contract level.\r\n\r\nThe platform has been audited by several third-party security firms and researchers, including Chainsecurity, which have determined that the protocol is secure and hence free of vulnerabilities."}, "mainframe": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3293/large/Mainframe_Token_Logo.png?1694762487", "rank": 221, "colors": ["#6E2EF4", "#6E2EF4"], "link": "https://hifi.finance/", "description": "Mainframe is the platform for decentralized applications.

RLC is short for \u201cRun on Lots of Computers.\u201d\r\n\r\niExec is headquartered at Lyon, France. It was founded by Gilles Fedak and Haiwu He, both are serving as Chief Executive Officer and Head of Asian-Pacific Region of iExec, respectively. Oleg Lodygensky is the Chief Technical Officer. Gilles Fedak received his PhD from the University of Paris Sud in 2003, and has been working as INRIA (Inventeurs du Monde Numerique) research scientist at ENS in Lyon, France. Similarly, Haiwu completed his M.Sc. and PhD from the University of Sciences and Technologies of Lille, France. On April 19, 2017, iExec launched its token sale and raised more than $12 million in exchange for 86,999,784 RLC.\r\n\r\nIn order to support dApps, smart contracts, and their platforms, iExec takes processing-intensive computations off-chain so as to keep a blockchain\u2019s on-chain functions running smoothly. To do this, iExec makes use of XtremWeb-HEP, an open-sourced Desktop Grid Software.  Desktop Grid computing (also known as Volunteer Computing) pools unused computing resources to be used by applications and platforms, and according to iExec\u2019s whitepaper, XtremWeb-HEP \u201cimplements all the needed features\u201d to make this possible on a global scale, including \u201cfault-tolerance, multi-applications, multi-users, hybrid public/private infrastructure, deployment of virtual images, data management, security and accountability, and many more.\u201d Essentially, with this software, dApps can utilize any computing resource in the iExec framework to run their programs.\r\n\r\nIn their whitepaper, the iExec team lays out the project\u2019s competitive landscape and explains these competitors in relation to iExec.

While iExec could theoretically take a step in this direction as it matures, it\u2019s not a storage platform; it\u2019s a computing platform. This does put it in competition with other decentralized computing protocols like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/golem\">Golem</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/golem\">SONM</a>. Both of these, however, are taking aim at a different animal.

A blockchain platform, like QANplatform is the basic infrastructure of all blockchain projects and applications. It is like the operating system on a computer. The whole ecosystem can only build and work on top of it. Connect it with real-world data, run automated smart contracts, build decentralized applications (DApps). According to HFS Research excerpt for IBM: Enterprise blockchain adoption is going through a \u201c90-9-1\u201d adoption challenge. 90% of companies are still trying to internalize the concept and its relevant impact. 9% of enterprises that identified relevant use cases are struggling to start with their PoCs and pilots. The 1% of enterprises that have successful pilots are challenged with scalability to a production-grade environment. To achieve blockchain mass adoption Qanplatform focused on these challenges. They built a lot of automation and integration to help freelance developers, blockchain development companies and enterprises start their blockchain PoCs (Proof-of-Concept) as fast as possible. It takes less than 5 minutes to deploy the QAN private blockchain to a preferred cloud platform and start building on it. \r\n\r\nWho Are the Founders of QANplatform ? \r\n\r\nJohann Polecsak, QAN's Chief Technology Officer is also an economist.

Launched in 2017, Bancor was the first DeFi protocol.\r\nToday, it generates millions in fees per month for depositors, offering up to 60% APR on tokens like ETH, WBTC, LINK, MATIC, AAVE & more. Bancor is owned by its community as a decentralized autonomous organization (Bancor DAO).\r\nThe protocol token used on the network is the \u201cBancor Network Token,\u201d BNT. The protocol\u2019s token allows traders to provide liquidity for the pools available on the network. Anyone can contribute liquidity to the pools. When liquidity providers contribute liquidity to a pool, they are eligible to receive fees for trades that pass through the pool. Liquidity providers will receive pool tokens that represent their share of liquidity, fees, and Liquidity Mining rewards in the pool.\r\n\r\nHow Many Bancor (BNT) Coins Are In Circulation?\r\n\r\nThe Bancor Network Token (BNT) has an elastic supply, afforded by the protocol's minting and burning of tokens to maintain trading liquidity levels in Bancor pools. Protocol-owned trading liquidity earns swap fees from trading volume, such that the protocol comes to hold more BNT over time. The protocol's new balance of BNT is then burned in exchange for pool tokens when LPs stake the equivalent amount of their own BNT. Due to swap fees earned, more BNT is ultimately burned than was initially supplied by the protocol.

The platform provides consumers with access to a variety of energy markets around the globe and is meant to be scalable to various energy infrastructures and regulations. The market is based on a dual-token ecosystem operating on two blockchain layers, POWR and Sparkz. POWR tokens allow consumers and hosts providing energy to interface with the ecosystem and are protected through Smart Bond technology. POWR tokens can be converted into Sparkz tokens, which can be used for frictionless transactions in the energy exchange market. The initial coin offering for POWR tokens became the largest crowd funding project in Australia and the 14th highest in the world.\r\n\r\nPower Ledger\u2019s team has immense expertise in both blockchain and electricity markets. They\u2019re comprised of six Board of Directors in addition to over ten full time-team members. Power Leger\u2019s five co-founders make up five of the six Board of Director seats of the company. The sixth board seat belongs to venture capitalist Bill Tai. Receiving his MBA from Harvard, Yai is a world-renowned venture capitalist. Tai\u2019s experience is quite extensive; he is currently the Chairman of Treasure Data and also a Board Member of Bitfury and Boxer.\r\n\r\nPower Ledger\u2019s POWR Presale sold out in just three days and raised over thirteen million dollars (AUD) in exchange for 190,000,000 tokens. After the presale, Power Ledger held an ICO to sell the remaining 160,000,000 POWR tokens allocated to Token Generation Event.  After both rounds, funds raised totaled thirty-four million dollars (AUD). In addition to money raised from its presale and ICO, the Australian Government also awarded Power ledger a grant for 8 million dollars (AUD) to develop its technology and concept further. (Australia has one of the highest costs of electricity in the world and thus has a large stake in the overall success the company).\r\n\r\nPower Ledger provides a blockchain-based marketplace that can truly change the world. Taking power away from large energy companies, Power Ledger gives local communities the ability to sell their excess solar power to neighbors. Power Ledger has created an energy distribution and tracking platform that allows consumers buy carbonless, sustainable energy at lower prices than what\u2019s offered by traditional electric companies. Power Ledger has plans to expand its operations to three continents worldwide and has amassed an army of powerful strategic partners to help achieve its goals.  With the planned release of multiple applications for its platform in the immediate future, the project has positioned itself to disrupt multiple energy markets throughout the world creating a bright future for all participants involved in this green revolution."}, "pendle": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/15069/large/Pendle_Logo_Normal-03.png?1634196276", "rank": 335, "colors": ["#152E52", "#DDDDDD"], "link": "https://pendle.finance/", "description": "Pendle is a protocol that enables the tokenization and trading of future yield.

To achieve its goal, Storj deploys several innovative technologies and methods to make sure that users are able to store and retrieve data in a fastest possible way while not compromising the security and integrity of data.\r\n\r\nStorj Labs Inc was founded in 2014 by Shawn Wilkinson with co-founders John Quinn.

One of the goals of QuarkChain is to utilize sharding technology to deliver over 1 million transactions per second (tps). Essentially, QuarkChain markets itself as a peer-to-peer blockchain with a high capacity throughput to help deliver fast and secure decentralized applications. The team behind QuarkChain created this blockchain to resolve the issue of scalability that all the major blockchains are currently facing. The team feels that because of the urgency of this issue, the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> community simply cannot afford to wait until they all agree on a solution. Instead, they feel that by offering different solutions, such as the one inherent in QuarkChain, this compels the community to split via a hard fork and find the solution that works best.\r\n\r\nQuarkChain encourages increased decentralization through multiple cheap nodes that then create a cluster that works as a super-full node. This prevents the high expenses associated with super-full nodes when the tps gets high. In terms of protection, all transactions within QuarkChain get the protection of 50 percent of the network\u2019s hash power. This makes a double-spending attack incredibly challenging, particularly when combined with QuarkChain\u2019s decentralized nature.\r\n\r\nQuarkChain relies on a two-layer blockchain structure. Sharding blockchains known as shards are the first layer, while the second layer is a root blockchain that confirms the shards\u2019 blocks.The major work on QuarkChain began in Q2 2017 with research into the problem of blockchain scalability. In Q4 of that year, the team drafted the whitepaper. In February 2018, it released the white paper and completed verification code 0.1. March 2018 saw the 0.1 versions of both the wallet and testnet. Now in Q2, the team is working on the testnet 1.0 and smart contract 0.1. In Q4 2018, the team will have the QuarkChain Core 1.0, along with the mainnet 1.0 and the SmartWallet 1.0. By Q2 2019, both the SmartWallet and QuarkChain Core will be in their 2.0 versions.\r\n\r\nQuarkChain is a decentralized blockchain network that aims to resolve the issues of scalability that plague existing networks by using sharding technology. In this way, QuarkChain can dramatically extend the usefulness of blockchain technology since many applications are limited by the scalability of existing blockchain networks. The project is still in progress, but QuarkChain has already made many positive steps and already began invite-based beta testing for the testnet, showing significant progress and potential.\r\n\r\nThe main features of Quarkchain are:\r\n\r\n1. Reshardable two-layered blockchain: Quarkchain consists of two layers of blockchains. We apply elastic sharding blockchains (shards) as the first layer, and a root blockchain as the second layer that confirms the blocks from the first layer. The second layer that confirms the blocks from the first layer. The second layer is flexible to be resharded as needed without changing the root layer.\r\n\r\n2. Guaranteed security by market-driven collaborative mining: To ensure the security of all transactions, a game-theoretic framework is designed for incentives, where at least 50% of overall hash powers are allocated to the root chain to prevent double spending attack on any transactions.\r\n\r\n3. Anti-centralized horizontal scalability: In any blockchain network with a high TPS, a super-full node can be extremely expensive, which encourages centralization. In contrast, QuarkChain allows multiple cheap nodes forming a cluster to replace a super-full node.\r\n\r\n4. Efficient cross-shard transactions: Cross-shard transactions in QuarkChain can be issued at any time, and confirmed in minutes. The speed of cross-shard transactions increases linearly as the number of shards increases.\r\n\r\n5. Simple account management: There is only one account needed for the entire blockchain (shards) in QuarkChain. All cryptocurrencies from different shards are stored in one smart wallet."}, "stader-maticx": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/25383/large/maticx.png?1674714297", "rank": 381, "colors": ["#05060F", "#0A0B14"], "link": "https://staderlabs.com/"}, "dusk-network": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/5217/large/D_ticker_purple_on_circle_%282%29.png?1563781659", "rank": 385, "colors": ["#988AC2", "#FEFEFE"], "link": "https://dusk.network/", "description": "Dusk Network is a high throughput permissionless blockchain aimed at providing privacy, programmability and auditability.\r\nDusk Network is currently in the Testnet phase and is a blockchain protocol for easy deployment of programmable zero-knowledge dApps, thus becoming the backbone of an open, permissionless and global privacy-oriented dApp ecosystem.\r\nDusk Network aims to remove technical barriers that have undermined mainstream issuance and trading of security tokens.

In the world of decentralised finance (DeFi), trusted and permissioned third-parties are no longer needed; banks have been replaced by trustless and permissionless lending protocols running on the blockchain (1).\r\nAmong the first-generation of DeFi lending protocols are Compound (2) and Aave (3). These protocols provide users with access to lending and borrowing capabilities for a handful of the most liquid ERC20 tokens.

It removes the requirement for third parties in order to provide a cheaper, more secure payment solution that works with all global currencies.\r\n\r\nWhen a user creates a request for payment, they define to which address the payment needs to be allocated and what the amount is. The user can also define the terms and conditions of the payment, upgrading a simple request into an invoice.

SelfKey is a self-sovereign identity system that is based on the blockchain and can provide control and management of digital identities to users. Additionally, users can utilize SelfKey to securely manage a crypto portfolio and instantly onboard immigration, cryptocurrency, and financial services. One of the unique aspects of SelfKey is its ability to work as an all-in-one identity solution for self-sovereignty. SelfKey utilizes a novel approach to identity management while also resolving the issues related to existing centralized identity management systems. These include the lack of accessibility to financial services and the tedious KYC processes that are paper based.\r\n\r\nOne of the standout features of SelfKey is the self-hosted data storage. This lets you secure your identity documents and assets locally, so there is no risk of a major data breach as with other similar systems. The KYC processes within SelfKey also stand out for their efficiency. Qualified certifiers can provide you with reusable identity authentication upon request. You can then share this authentication multiple times with several service providers. This, in turn, prevents you from wasting time and effort with a traditional KYC onboarding process that is typically tedious. SelfKey additional minimizes data because of its blockchain-based verifiable claims protocol. This protocol lets you as an identity owner prove you meet the ID attributes required for a specific service or product without any need to actually share your identity document. In other words, you can provide proof of your ID without sharing the ID, keeping the data you send to a minimum. Of course, SelfKey also provides the full functionality you want from a cryptocurrency wallet, including the ability to securely manage cryptocurrency assets like ETH, KEY, and the other ERC-20 tokens.Edmund Lowell is the founder of SelfKey. \r\n\r\nOn his LinkedIn page, Edmund describes himself as an entrepreneur whose \u201cskill sets lie at the crossroads of finance, technology, and law/regulations.\u201d Additionally, he has been involved with other projects related to personal data protection, self-sovereign digital identity systems, blockchains, and distributed ledgers. Terry Lin is the product manager for this venture. In the past, Terry has been associated with many established projects including, AMZ Tracker, UBS and Build My Online Store. Lastly, Ari Propis is the accounting backbone of SelfKey. He has been in the crypto domain for more than five years and has previously worked as a consultant for various blockchain and international accounting startups.

The two most notable examples of these being the $55 million DAO hack and the $30 million Parity wallet bug. These issues not only affect the people who\u2019ve had their funds stolen, but they also diminish the credibility of the entire ecosystem.\r\n\r\nQuantstamp is making smart contracts more secure through automated software testing and a system of bug bounties. Although starting with Ethereum, the team is building the protocol to be available on any DApp platform in the long run.In an industry where security is a primary concern and bugs have caused the theft of millions of dollars, Quantstamp should help to legitimize blockchain projects and ensure that large-scale smart contract hacks are a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nQuantstamp held a successful ICO in November 2017 in which the team raised a little over $30 million dollars. They distributed 650 million (65%) QSP out of the 1 billion total supply to ICO participants at a price of $0.072 per token. After the usual post-ICO volatility, the QSP price stabilized at around $0.10 (~0.000005 BTC) through the end of November. The price followed the trend of the altcoin market and rose rapidly to an all-time high of $0.82 (~0.000051 BTC) before slowly falling to its current price of ~$0.286. The QSP price weathered the beginning of the year market downfall better than most other altcoins."}, "kompete": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/24298/large/KOMPETE_LOGO.?1669463130", "rank": 1018, "colors": ["#360B0B", "#6B5252"], "link": "https://kompete.game/", "description": "KOMPETE Token is the official marketplace utility token for the KOMPETE Bazaar, an in-game secondary marketplace to buy and sell KOMPETE cosmetics.\r\n\r\nKOMPETE is a team-based multiplayer game that's free to play.

PoS token holders can deposit their tokens onto the pSTAKE platform to mint 1:1 pegged ERC-20 wrapped unstaked tokens represented as pTOKENs (e.g., pATOM). Users can convert pTOKENs into 1:1 wrapped ERC-20 staked representatives called stkTOKENs by staking the underlying deposited PoS tokens. stkTOKENs, representing staked tokens, accrue staking rewards in the form of pTOKENs (This mirrors the workings of most PoS chains where staking rewards aren't automatically compounded but earned in the form of liquid tokens which can be claimed by a user at any point in time).\r\n\r\npSTAKE allows its users to utilize stkTOKENs in various DeFi protocols to earn additional yield on top of their staking rewards.\r\n\r\nExample: Alice wraps (deposits) 100 ATOM on pSTAKE. She receives 100 pATOM representing 100 ATOM deposited onto the pSTAKE platform. As long Alice has 100 pATOM, she can redeem 100 ATOM (1:1) from the platform back into her Cosmos wallet by burning off her pATOM balance (This is the unwrapping process).\r\n\r\nAfter receiving 100 pATOM, she decides to stake the underlying deposit of 100 ATOM on the Cosmos Hub to earn staking rewards (assume ~7% Annually). On staking, Alice receives 100 stkATOM, and her pATOM balance is now changed to 0 (pATOM burned, stkATOM minted). Let's assume there's an already existing stkATOM-ETH liquidity pool on SushiSwap. Alice supplies all her stkATOM and an equivalent amount of ETH into the Sushi pool to become a liquidity provider (LP). A portion of the trading fees generated on SushiSwap is distributed to all the LPs (Assume that this results in 9% yields annually). Thus, if Alice doesn't face any Impermanent loss at the end of the year, she would earn (7+9)% yield on her 100 ATOM holdings instead of the usual 7% she would have received by simply staking (and not liquid staking). Alice, being a PoS coin staker, leverages pSTAKE's technology to generate additional yield.\""}, "blockv": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1266/large/blockv.png?1547351380", "rank": 1036, "colors": ["#6C838D", "#788F99"], "link": "https://blockv.io/", "description": "BLOCKv, the shared protocol for the blockchain developer stack, represents the interface moment in the maturation of the blockchain sector.

Aave strives to break through the traditional bank loans system with a more efficient solution. Aave also uniquely allows a borrower and a lender to decide on important loan details that can eliminate the need of a middle man. Due to the elimination of middlemen, process fee for a loan does not exist on this platform. This provide convenience to any lender and borrower to create loans on their agreed terms. Decentralized lending has fixed many issues and one of the reasons why is the transparency of loan.\r\n\r\nThe Ethereum network provides a transparent ledger where all transactions are available to be inspected. Secondly, it isn\u2019t necessary to find a trusted loan provider because all collateral which is the digital asset for loans are stored and locked in a smart contract and broadcasted on the public ethereum blockchain. It is also flexible for borrower to manage the collateral by refilling or withdrawing part of it. Borrower may make such changes when the lender is notified and aware of such movement. If the lender finds out that the action is not communicated, the lender is allowed to initiate a margin call.  \r\n\r\nThis year, Aave has made a major upgrades in its Q1 2018. They have deployed the new development for their peer-to-peer lending application named Alpha 0.3. The development process of Alpha 0.3 has started since the early of 2017. The new release also includes a completely new user interface which targets to lower the learning curve of user experience on the app. Furthermore, the new user interface has new sections to make lending process simpler such as including a \u2018My Loan\u2019 section, collectible badges and more. Other than that, the team is also in the process of developing more updates for the smart contracts. Hence, the team has decided to provide zero-fee lending with the use of LEND token as a medium of exchange, as an alternative to borrowing in Ethereum. The purpose of this is to provide a cross-blockchain lending currency which will prompt users to use LEND as the medium of exchange. \r\n"}, "everrise": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/16367/large/Logo_EverRise_Icon_logo.png?1642576670", "rank": 1039, "colors": ["#C53C35", "#EF8835"], "link": "https://www.everrise.com/", "description": "EverRise is a blockchain technology company focused on increasing accessibility to decentralized finance by bringing security solutions to the space.

Data Consumers can trust the authenticity of the data they purchase, \u201cNurseries\u201d (Data Producers) are compensated fairly every time their data is used, and \u201cPioneers\u201d (Data Vendors) have the incentive to create innovative Constellations.

This is where Quadrant differentiates itself from its competitors.\r\n\r\nQuadrant is designed to work with both centralised and decentralised services. The architecture consists of the core Quadrant blockchain, clients (Data Producer, Data Consumer and Anchor), and Guardian Nodes. Quadrant will operate on a Proof of Authority consensus mechanism so that it can handle more transactions, operate at a lower gas price, achieve faster transactions, and restrict malicious nodes from entering data into the network. An external Proof of Work chain will be used as an anchor for security purposes. For the time being, the Ethereum blockchain will be used for anchoring but it can be replaced by any public chain in the future if needed.\r\n\r\nQuadrant will utilise two different currencies for its network: eQuad and QUAD. QUAD, a utility token, is designed to be used solely on the network. It will be used to stamp data, support simple and complex access structures, simple and complex subscription payments, and for staking by Elons. eQuad is an ERC-20-compliant token that will be sold during the Token Generation Event (TGE). It may be converted into QUAD via a gateway when the Quadrant mainnet is launched.\r\n\r\n"}, "skey-network": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/13425/large/SKEY_Network_logo_black.png?1633421778", "rank": 1144, "colors": ["#5241AE", "#764AEB"], "link": "https://skey.network/", "description": "Skey Network aims to connect the physical with blockchain database via a \"Blockchain or Things\" bridge."}, "rabbitx": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/30048/large/RBX.png?1683253839", "rank": 1145, "colors": ["#171515", "#E53645"], "link": "https://rabbitx.io", "description": "What is the project about?\r\nRabbitX is a global permissionless perpetuals exchange powered by Starknet.

It is created by the combination of technologies of RFID and blockchain, which push forwards the integration of block chain and the Internet of Things.\r\n\r\nWaltonchain combines blockchain with IoT (specifically RFID) to create a management system for supply chains. The project is named after Charlie Walton, the inventor of RFID technology and a pioneer in the space. Logistics systems are complex and commonly involve several different parties. As these systems grow, it becomes increasingly tough for businesses in the same vertical to coordinate with each other. On top of that, individual entities may have different processes that further hinder the ability to transfer data back and forth. Waltonchain uses RFID identification to track products during each step of production and distribution. \r\n\r\nThe data associated with each item is stored on an immutable blockchain that ensures its accuracy no matter where in the process it is.The Waltonchain team is loaded with supply chain experience. Do Sanghyuk, one of the co-founders, was previously the Director of the Korean Standard Products Association. The other co-founder, Xu Fangcheng was the Supply Chain Management Director of Septwolves Group Ltd. The team is getting support from their Chief Scientist Advisor, Kim Sukku \u2013 a former vice president of Samsung. Waltonchain has no shortage of partnerships \u2013 several of which are with Chinese provincial governments. The team is working with the Fujian government to create a \u201csmart maritime\u201d blockchain incubator, and with the Jinhu government to build smart air purification and monitoring systems.\r\n\r\nThe Waltonchain architecture makes use of a novel consensus mechanism known as Proof-of-Stake & Trust (PoST). Waltonchain innovates on the traditional proof-of-stake (PoS) model and integrates a node reputation based system into the consensus mechanism. PoST provides for adjustable difficulty for each node, to ensure that integrity in the ecosystem is rewarded. Waltonchain also gives sub-chain developers the option to choose their own consensus mechanism, for example, sub-chains can strictly just have PoS as a consensus mechanism, and not PoST. Waltonchain, by use of its RFID technology, has introduced a novel way with which blockchain can solve not only the inefficiencies found with supply chain management, but also IoT.

This architecture allows these identities, known as Accumulate Digital Identifiers (ADIs), to be processed and validated in parallel over the Accumulate network. Each ADI also possesses a hierarchical set of keys with different priority levels that allow users to manage their security over time and create complex signature authorization schemes that expand the utility of multi-signature transactions.

More specifically STIMA is a utility token, that through a cryptographic system correlates its native crypto currency to the value of physical assets. Ultimately this token allows for an economic exchange that goes beyond conventional rules surrounding transactional elements related to a given asset. In particular, a person holding an asset with a proven intrinsic value determined by objective valuation metrics can unburden the asset sale process by receiving STIMA. In turn, STIMA as an ecosystem will allow its wider investor base to tap into a pool of historically appreciating assets, with fractional ownership guaranteeing diversification to all token holders. These assets have all been minted by owners prior to the listing date on crypto exchanges, optimizing their asset\u2019s value and allowing them, should they choose to, unlock their tokens by handing staked property into a STIMA accredited vault.

Our mission is to build a consensus driven map of the world, empowering a fully decentralized web3 economy with verifiable location data. FOAM incentivizes the infrastructure needed for privacy-preserving and fraud-proof location verification. The starting point for FOAM is static proof of location, where a community of Cartographers curate geographic Points of Interest on the FOAM map. Through global community-driven efforts, FOAM\u2019s dynamic proof of location protocol will enable a permissionless and privacy-preserving network of radio beacons that is independent from external centralized sources and capable of providing secure location verification services.\r\n\r\nFOAM Token Functionality\r\n1. Add and Curate Geographic Points of Interest\r\nThe FOAM Spatial Index Visualizer allows Cartographers to participate in interactive TCR POIs on a map. Users can add points to the map, validate new candidates and verify the map by visiting real world locations. The FOAM Token Curated Registry unlocks mapping in a secure and permissionless fashion and allows locations to be ranked and maintained by token balances. Users can deposit FOAM Tokens into POIs on the map to increase attention those POIs might receive.\r\n\r\n2. Signal for Zone Incentivisation\r\nA further potential use of the FOAM Token by Cartographers is to stake their FOAM Tokens to Signal. Signaling is a mechanism designed to allow Cartographers to incentivize the expansion and geographic coverage of the FOAM network. To Signal, a Cartographer stakes FOAM Tokens to a Signaling smart contract by reference to a particular area. These staked tokens serve as indicators of demand, and are proportionate to (i) the length of time staking (the earlier, the better), and (ii) the number of tokens staked (the less well-served areas, the better). In the context of the contingent Dynamic Proof of Location concept (described further in the Product Whitepaper), these indicators are the weighted references that determine the spatial mining rewards.\r\n\r\n3. Contribute to Potential Secure Location Services as Zone Anchor or Verifier\r\nThe FOAM protocol may allow users to provide work and secure localization services and location verification for smart contracts and be rewarded for their own efforts with new FOAM Tokens in the form of mining rewards. Devices and real world contracts can be programmed to designate attestations and track interactions and transactions on the map. With the addition of necessary radio hardware by individual users and the grass roots expansion of the FOAM network, it may be possible for location status to be proved in a different manner. Location could be proved through a time synchronization protocol that would ensure continuity of a distributed clock, whereby specialized hardware could synchronize nodes\u2019 clocks over radio to provide location services in a given area.

Cardstack Token (CARD) is a utility token allowing end- users and businesses to use applications that interact with multiple blockchains, decentralized protocols, app-coin-backed dApps, and cloud- based services while paying a single on-chain transaction fee. \r\n\r\nThe main value proposition of the Cardstack ICO is to breakdown the user experience of disparate software, cloud and blockchain silos which now exist on various levels of the digital world, allowing both developers and users to engage in customizable workflows. To overcome these disparate app silos, Cardstack offers a new UI, deployed via the web or as a peer-to-peer app, which turns each service created by open-source developers into a \u201ccard\u201d. Each card comprises a visual embodiment of key information, whereby users can then connect related cards for any type of workflow or utility they desire. These cards are the point of interaction between local services, cloud-based services and blockchain services all on one interface called Cardstack Hub. Underlying the Cardstack ecosystem is the Cardstack Token (CARD), an <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>-based ERC20 token.\r\n\r\nThe Cardstack Team comprises many open source contributors. Check out the full list of contributors here. Heading the development of Cardstack is Christopher Tse. Christopher holds a BSc in Computer Science from Columbia University and is the Co-Founder of Monegraph and dotBlockchain Media. He has also served as Senior Director of Innovation at Businessweek. Ed Faulkner is the Lead Developer at Cardstack. He holds a Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT. He has founded three of his own tech ventures of which all are currently operational. Hassan Abdel-Rahman is the Lead Blockchain Developer for Cardstack. He holds a BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics from Colorado School of Mines. Previous roles include over 2 years as Senior Software Designer at Monegraph and Principal Engineer at McGraw-Hill Education.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important features Cardstack will deploy is an entry channel payment system that does not require users to purchase cryptocurrency from an exchange. Users can simply pay with fiat, such as a credit card, to purchase CARD tokens directly on the platform, bypassing the need for any prior familiarity with crypto. Once users purchase CARD tokens, they are stored on a native wallet accessible from the Cardstack Hub. CARD tokens held in the native wallet are then used to purchase SSCs for every app and service they users with to access. To make any project appealing to the mass consumer market, this type of simplified entry into the cryptospace is a necessity. Cardstack have made some progress on the development front. The code for over 30 initial modules on the Cardstack platform has been made available via their Github. Also, the Solidity code for the Scalable Payment Pool has already been open-sourced. The Scalability Payment Pool is one of the core back-end mechanisms of the platform that issues rewards to developers for their work.\r\n\r\nCardstack aims to create an economically-sustainable software ecosystem that avoids the problems of today\u2019s centralized platforms. It\u2019s an \u201cexperience layer\u201d for the decentralized internet of the future, allowing users to combine services across cloud apps and decentralized apps. The ecosystem revolves around the use of Cardstack tokens, or CARD."}, "pooltogether": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/14003/large/PoolTogether.png?1613585632", "rank": 1640, "colors": ["#572FB6", "#703DDF"], "link": "https://pooltogether.com/"}, "jeet-detector-bot": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/28105/large/new_logo.png?1669370143", "rank": 1642, "colors": ["#25323B", "#25323C"], "link": "https://www.jdb.finance/", "description": "The blockchain is a platform for limitless potential, one that is also corrupted by the antics that are performed in it. \r\n\r\nWe believe that blockchain data should be organized in an understandable and easy to process way for all users.

Liquidity providers can compound their earnings by leveraging their LP tokens to mint UND (decentralized, cross-chain, stablecoin soft pegged to the US dollar) and uETH. The protocol is characterized by several unique features, some of which include:\r\n\r\nGet Liquidity Without Removing Assets From Liquidity Pool\r\nUsers can keep their liquidity on a DEX in a liquidity pool and still have additional stablecoins to trade on different AMMs. For example, if a user has $10,000 locked in the $USDT-$USDC pool on Uniswap, that user can lock up their LPTs on Unbound and mint stable coins ($UND) worth $8,000 on BSC to trade on PancakeSwap while the users liquidity is still on Uniswap thereby enjoying the benefits of fee on Uniswap and having enough liquidity to trade on PancakeSwap. This way Unbound will be able to move liquidity from AMMs across different chains to PancakeSwap and vice versa without physically removing liquidity.\r\n\r\nDebt-Free Borrowing\r\nThe protocol charges no interest on loans taken out by the liquidity providers. To redeem their loan, they simply repay the amount of UND or uETH they borrowed to retrieve their collateral (i.e. their LP tokens). \r\n\r\nLiquidation-free Collateralization\r\nUnbound completely nixes the liquidation engine seen with more collateralized lending platforms. As a result, users do not need to concern themselves with the potential liquidation of their collateral. Instead, Unbound uses SAFU, an emergency insurance fund, to secure the collateralized assets of borrowers during so-called \u2018black swan\u2019 events. \r\n \r\nPerpetual Borrowing \r\nAt Unbound, loans have no fixed repayment deadline. Users can unlock their collateralized assets any time by paying back the outstanding debt \u2014 without any restrictions.\r\n\r\n The UND Stablecoin \r\nUnbound Finance\u2019s first product is the cross-chain, decentralized stablecoin known as UND. It is an ERC-20 token soft-pegged to the US dollar and backed by user deposits.\r\n \r\nSecured Price Oracles\r\nThe platform uses a geometric mean of highly secured price oracles including Uniswap\u2019s TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price) and Chainlink to obtain accurate asset price information. It also makes use of the \u201cblock limit lock mechanism\u201d as a security measure against flash loan attacks and other related cyber-attacks. This is a protection mechanism that forces users to wait for at least three to five blocks of confirmation to again interact with the smart contracts. Besides this, the protocol has been subjected to a series of audits to further enhance the security of the platform.\r\n \r\nCross-Chain Bridges\r\nUnbound is working to establish strategic partnerships with projects building across multiple blockchains. In line with this, it is also constructing cross-chain bridges to enable UND and other synthetic assets to be transferred across multiple blockchains.

Crypto Bonds introduce proof of long-term position in DeFi liquidity pools, and will naturally strengthen the core of DeFi finance as a whole.

Using a Crypto Bond, an investor is able to lock liquidity-pair tokens with the corresponding dollar-to-dollar value in SYNC at some guaranteed interest rate of SYNC upon maturation. Dividend paying versions are also available. Therefore, this occurs in inflation, minting the principle plus interest.\r\n\r\nCrypto Bond Interest Rates\r\nSYNC balances itself through daily, self-correcting interest rates.\r\nInterest rates of bonds depends on three factors.\r\n1. Total supply of sync in the market.\r\n2. Duration of bond\r\n3. Total bonded amount of that liquidity pair token\r\n\r\nPlease see the full whitepaper and website https://www.syncbond.com for more information."}, "meowl": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/31142/large/logo_200_200.png?1690967943", "rank": 2421, "colors": ["#6E6E6E", "#F58ABB"], "link": "https://meowl.xyz", "description": "Meowl is a Discord Bot-centred platform that aims to innovate DeFi solutions.

It's a novel solution to the gas fee problem, enabling users to conduct transactions on the Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible networks without incurring gas costs.\r\n\r\nThe ecosystem will boast of the following applications:\r\n\r\nMEV free Gasless swap - These swaps leverage the concept of relayers or protocol wallets to facilitate trades between users. Relayers act as intermediaries, executing trades on behalf of users and absorbing the gas fees associated with the transactions. This approach allows users to interact with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or execute smart contract operations seamlessly without worrying about gas fees.\r\n\r\nGasless bridge - Its a technological solution that allows users to transfer assets or data between different blockchain networks without incurring gas fees. The approach here is known as \"meta-transactions.\" Meta-transactions involve a relayer or a trusted third party that pays the gas fees on behalf of the user. When a user wants to transfer assets across chains, they submit a transaction to the gasless bridge, which is then relayed to the target blockchain by the relayer. The relayer covers the gas fees required to execute the transaction, while the user only needs to pay the relayer's fee for their service.\r\n\r\nNfts gasless minting - Gasless minting is made possible by utilizing off-chain technologies that enable the creation and storage of NFT metadata without directly interacting with the underlying blockchain. These solutions leverage techniques like batch minting, bundling transactions, or employing sidechains to reduce costs and congestion on EVM compatible networks.\r\n\r\nGasless launchpad - This leverage smart contract functionalities and technologies like meta-transactions to facilitate feeless transactions. These mechanisms handle the gas fees on behalf of users, abstracting away the complexity and ensuring a seamless user experience. Overall, gasless launchpads on EVM compatible networks play a crucial role in driving the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies by removing barriers to entry, enhancing user experience, and democratizing access to token sales and investment opportunities.\r\n\r\nZK anonymous swap - By leveraging ZK-SNARKs, anonymous swap protocols offer several advantages. First and foremost, they provide users with a high level of privacy and anonymity. Transactions executed through these protocols do not disclose the participants' identities, transaction amounts, or any other sensitive information. This enhanced privacy protection is particularly important in the context of decentralized finance, where preserving financial confidentiality is crucial."}, "0xmonero": {"link": "https://0xmonero.com/", "description": "0xMR is a mineable privacy token on the Ethereum blockchain"}, "0xs": {"link": "https://0xs.ai/", "description": "What is the project about?\r\n0xShibarium is an all-encompassing platform designed for Shibarium L2, focusing on liquidity checks and locks.

Maintained by a group of aviation professionals, Aeron wants to reduce air transport-related accidents, which it says currently numbers around 3302 per year. One of the major causes of such accidents is the lack of real experience among pilots, since unsecured flight log data from them is susceptible to fraud and forgery. Also, due to \"pay to fly\" experiences, corrupt flight schools, negligence of aircraft operators, the primary data driving any decision is affected.\r\n\r\nAeron is built upon a robust and cryptographically secure database that makes it unique compared to other online travel companies, travel search services or internal applications made for flight officials.

Current lending and borrowing protocols which utilize smart contracts require active\r\ngovernance (e.g. to set rates and to update contracts) and/or rely on external price feeds (such as oracles like Chainlink).

Pools are\r\ncreated permissionlessly, meaning anyone can create a pool to borrow arbitrary fungible tokens\r\nusing arbitrary fungible or non-fungible tokens as collateral. Therefore, no governance process is\r\nneeded to whitelist approved tokens.\r\n\r\nPrice specified lending: Ajna replaces external price feeds (oracles) by allowing lenders to input\r\nthe price at which they\u2019re willing to lend. This price is the amount of quote token (i.e. the token\r\nthey are lending) they are willing to lend per unit of collateral pledged by the borrower. For\r\nexample, if a lender deposits at price 100, they are willing to lend 100 units of quote token per\r\none unit of collateral. Ajna pools separate prices into predefined buckets to reduce the\r\ncomplexity of the protocol, prices are therefore hereon referred to as \u201cbuckets\u201d.

It was introduced to fit all the needs of the different stakeholders in the ecosystem.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Makes ATF Unique?\r\n\r\nBeing deflationary (15% of the paid fees are burned after every swap) is a core property of the ATF token. This mechanism aims at protecting its holders. With every burn, the value of ATF increases theoretically.\r\n\r\nLiquidity Providers can claim their fees at any moment, without any impact on the pool value or volume as these fees are paid with the ATF token. This has many advantages:\r\n\r\n- LPs can further custom their strategy by deciding if they should reinvest their collected fees, diversify into new pools or simply keep them in ATF. By introducing the ATF, we give LPs the ability to create new source of earnings, independently from their initial pool strategy.\r\n\r\n- Crypto-native projects are incentivised to launch liquidity pools with their own token in the Antfarm ecosystem. It gives them the opportunity to put their stack at work. They can use their collected fees (in ATF) to pay their day-to-day expenses as a company. It prevents them from selling their own token to do so.\r\n\r\n- For very risky pairs, if one asset value goes to 0, the LPs will lose all their stake in the pair. Thanks to Antfarm's fee system in ATF, even if one of the assets goes to 0, they would be compensated with a certain % from swapping fees. This is a strong risk mitigation.\r\n\r\nAntfarm is even greater when markets are turbulent! This is when most swappers will be drawn to our pools. As ATF are required to pay for all swapping fees, the demand for ATF will be become substantial in such times."}, "antimatter": {"link": "https://antimatter.finance/", "description": "A simple lightweight onchain DeFi derivative protocol.

It was launched with the aim of becoming the \u2018official\u2019 cryptocurrency of Iceland. AUR was a pioneer in the area of country-specific cryptocurrencies. AUR was launched on the 25th of January, 2014, by an anonymous developer who went by the pseudonym of Baldur Friggjar \u00d3\u00f0insson. It was originally based on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/litecoin\">Litecoin</a>, using the Scrypt algorithm with a Proof of Work mechanism, but was later updated to use a multi-algorithm architecture in 2016, forked from <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/digibyte\">DigiByte</a>.\r\n\r\nAuroracoin uses the PoW consensus mechanism, which utilises device hashing power to solve a complex mathematical problem in order to authenticate a transaction proposed to be stored in the blockchain. The difficulty of solving the problem ensures that authenticating forged transactions is very difficult unless the attacker owns an impractically large chunk of the network\u2019s total hashing power. AUR is one of the only cryptocurrencies to use a combination of five different hashing algorithms, namely Gr\u00f8stl, Qubit, scrypt, SHA-256, and Skein.\r\n\r\nWhile initially very popular, Auroracoin has seen little to no activity for a while, with poor marketing, and frequent dev team changes. Reasons for little growth have been various, from slow adoption in Iceland, to developers leaving and joining the project midway. However, it is expected to not go lower than the recent low, and might see a rise as AUR plans to launch a more aggressive marketing campaign in Iceland to promote the coin among the masses. Unlike most other altcoins, Auroracoin has made extensive changes to the original codebase.

ACCUs are carbon credits issued by the Clean Energy Regulator of the Australian Government. The BCAU token is the only token backed by ACCUs and is focused on maintaining high integrity carbon. It was created to allow the public to purchase ACCUs as an investment opportunity, opening up access beyond wholesale clients.\r\n\r\nBetaCarbon was founded by Guy Dickinson in November 2021, who previously served as the Head of Global Markets and Treasurer of HSBC Australia. Seeing an opportunity in carbon trading, Guy left HSBC and established BetaCarbon.\r\n\r\nOwning the BCAU token provides a twofold benefit. Firstly, it offers an investment opportunity in a previously restricted asset class. Secondly, it contributes to real-world change by reducing the supply of ACCUs available to major CO2e emitters in Australia. This forces emitters to either change their practices to comply with emissions caps or purchase credits at a higher price due to lower ACCU availability.\r\n\r\nFor typical consumers, the BCAU token serves solely as an investment. The tokens are minted as more ACCUs are held by BetaCarbon's custodian, increasing the notional amount of ACCUs held for the BCAU token. It's important to note that despite fluctuations in the total supply of BCAU tokens, they remain 100% notionally backed at all times. Changes in supply do not impact individual holdings. The tokens can be bought, traded, or accumulated to balance emissions.\r\n\r\nBy purchasing BetaCarbon tokens, the demand for carbon credits increases, incentivizing new carbon projects and making emissions more expensive. BetaCarbon offers the opportunity to buy, hold, and trade digitized representations of high-quality carbon credits, contributing to the transition to a low-carbon economy.\r\n\r\nAustralia's approach to carbon markets differs from others.

In July 2021 the bitcci AG, the daughter company of the bitcci Group AG started an ICO and raised about 7.5 Mio USD winning over 5000 Token holders. bitcci moved to a new and larger office in the Cryptovalley area of Zug / Switzerland in December 2021.

The global sex market was worth over $ 200 billion in 2021. The potential for growth is huge, because the internet has significantly changed the way in which sex is perceived and how it is experienced. For example, since 1980, the number of men who purchase sexual services has doubled worldwide. In addition to the great potential for the industry, there are also many challenges in the industry for which bitcci is developing unique solutions. Along the value chain of sexual services, we offer sex workers a modern package of services and training programmes marked by free self-determination that ensure their stable and long-term loyalty to the bitcci ecosystem and a high work-life balance. The fact that our IT system is already in operation in the 5 large nightclubs in Switzerland gives us the necessary business data and know-how regarding their needs. The operation of these 5 nightclubs has shown us that there is a considerable need for optimization, modernization, standardization and regulation in the industry.

The more $BTC20 tokens a person stakes, the higher the rewards they are going to receive.\r\n\r\nWhat makes your project unique?\r\nBuilding upon the foundations of the Bitcoin release mechanism, which is Proof-of-Work (PoW), BTC20 introduces the less energy intensive Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model that rewards participants in proportion to their staked tokens. Through this mechanism, BTC20 presents a unique opportunity for individuals to earn a substantial share of the rewards released through the Ethereum-based staking contract. The more individuals stake their BTC20, the greater their share of the released rewards. This design fosters a community-driven ecosystem, where collective action drives the prosperity of all participants.\r\n\r\nHistory of your project.\r\nBTC20 presale started on the 17th of July and ended on the 29th of July, raising $6,050,000 and reaching its presale goal in only 12 days. \r\nStaking of BTC20 tokens started on the 9th of August and over 40% of the supply, $2.5 million have been staked in the first 18 hours since the launch. \r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s next for your project?\r\nAfter the presale, 14,950,000 BTC20 remain tokens were locked in the staking contract to reward staking pool participants. With every Bitcoin block confirmation, 50 BTC20 tokens are released and distributed to all participants in the staking pool.  Rewards accrue in real time every 10 minutes. \r\nSimilar to Bitcoin, the project will have 4-year halvings. BTC20 is programmed to reduce its simulated block rewards by 50% every four years, starting at 50 BTC20 every 10 minutes. The first BTC20 halving will be in 2025 when the rewards will be reduced to 25 BTC20 per block. The second BTC20 Halving will be in 2029 and the rewards will reduced to 12.5 BTC20 per block. The third BTC20 Halving will be 2033 when the rewards will be reduced to 6.25 BTC20 per block.\r\n\r\nWhat can your token be used for?\r\nThe project is a great opportunity for buyers to receive staking rewards and earn some passive income. The percentage of rewards users earn is directly proportional to the overall number of tokens staked.

It's a user-first dapp platform which makes blockchain based services accessible for first time builders and end users so that everyone can enjoy the increased network transparency, data privacy and reliability that decentralisation offers.\r\n\r\nHow does CENNZnet work?\r\nThe dual token economy\r\nCENNZnet uses a unique dual token system in order to help developers, users and token holders get the best from the network.\r\nCENNZnet has 2 tokens:\r\nCENNZ - the staking token which works separately to block rewards. This means it can increase in value without impacting the cost of using the network. This is important so the price of CENNZ can continue to increase without impacting the amount developers and users pay to use DApps.\r\nCPAY is the gas in the network and is used to pay transaction fees. It is also a block reward payment in staking. It\u2019s designed to be algorithmically stable, so it will retain a steady value. This means developers creating DApps on the network can easily predict the cost of their application, and stakers can easily predict the value of their stake.\r\n\r\nConsensus mechanism: Proof of Stake\r\nCENNZnet uses a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. This is where node operators hold, or stake, their tokens in a particular wallet as collateral against their promise to perform their duties correctly. If they do perform their duties correctly they receive a reward in our CPAY token. If they do not then the staked tokens are slashed, or fined. Other token holders can also stake their tokens against node operators (validators) of their choosing in order to receive a portion of the CPAY reward.\r\nThis system helps to secure the network by incentivising the community to follow protocol and prevent attacks.\r\n\r\nGovernance\r\nCENNZnet functions 100% on-chain using blockchain\u2019s built in voting mechanisms. In CENNZnet governance, validators and node operators are required to vote on proposals using a direct voting mechanism (similar to direct democracy) to achieve consensus. Voting results are governed algorithmically and their automatic execution is built directly into the protocol. The winning decisions then automatically integrated into the chain.\r\nCENNZnet pre-built runtime modules\r\nDApp builders have access to core CENNZnet modules which provide the building blocks to common functions required for DApp users.\r\n\r\nNFT\r\nUsing the CENNZnet NFT module users can mint and sell NFTs on CENNZnet without ever needing to touch a smart contract. Instead, they can create custom NFTs using just a Javascript API or point and click with a UI.\r\n\r\nCENNZX\r\nCENNZX is a spot exchange module which enables a seamless fee payment experience on CENNZnet and makes token exchange instant and easy. The CENNZX Spot eliminates rent extraction and centralised services while prioritising decentralisation, usability and security.\r\n\r\nGeneric Asset\r\nGeneric Asset protocol enables CENNZnet\u2019s multicurrency economy. The module allows transaction fees to be paid in any asset, provided there\u2019s liquidity in the CENNZX in-chain GAS exchange. CENNZX will then seamlessly convert the asset into the official gas token, CPAY. This streamlines onboarding and in-app experience by eliminating the need for new users to learn about different token types and simply opting for their favoured currency.\r\n\r\nDoughnut\r\nThe Doughnut module is the secret sauce of the CENNZnet blockchain. Doughnuts are proofs of delegation between two or more cryptographic keypairs. They allow us to prove that one address delegates something to another address and allows permissions and rules to be carried between different networks without the need for a centralised server.

The protocol achieves this through constantly analyzing and learning how nodes interact with their neighbors.\r\n\r\nHow Does the CORE Protocol Attract People?\r\n\r\n\u2022Lightweight\r\n\u2022Compatible with the self-interests of each peer, or ability to select the best neighbors\r\n\u2022Robust against adversarial actions: A CORE peer does not need all details about a candidate neighbor to decide whether to connect\r\n\u2022Incentivizes peers to relay blocks promptly.\r\n\u2022Naturally adaptive to varying hash-power\r\n\r\n\r\nCore Multi-Chain is the next generation of blockchain protocol designed to enable legacy, current, and future blockchains to scale and communicate seamlessly. CORE offers a wide variety of possibilities in the blockchain space due to its sharding, interoperability, and central algorithm.\r\nBy providing a fair and secure platform, CORE allows users to regain control over their personal information. The project offers a scalable network featuring functionalities that bypass current blockchain limitations. CORE intends to provide an environment-friendly system that is sustainable, interoperable and provides enhanced throughput. \r\n\r\nHighlights\r\n\u2022Network Efficiency \u2013 CORE contains an AI model at the core of its blockchain. This AI Model speeds up the network\u2019s collective transaction processing times and also enables the network to operate under attacks or faults. \r\n\u2022Security \u2013 The AI model helps coordinate the nodes on the network while also strengthening security on the CORE blockchain. This is accomplished through the network\u2019s outlier detection protocol, which monitors for unusual behavior. The AI randomly selects nodes to test and gather data, monitoring network activity outside of the norm. In this phase, any corrupt nodes will be identified. \r\n\u2022Transaction Privacy Protection Layer: CORE transaction privacy protection layer (TPPL) adds an extra layer of security and privacy when transacting on its blockchain. This universal layer is applied to every CORE-connected chain and can be applied to the major public blockchains.\r\n\u2022Randomness \u2013 The CORE Multi-Chain network combines Verifiable Random Function (VRF) and Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) into a single hybrid solution, thus achieving true Randomness within the network. Randomness influences the difficulty in the mining function of PoW blockchains and periodically chooses the validators in a PoS blockchain.\r\n\u2022Scalability \u2013 To address the scalability issue of Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance, CORE enhanced the consensus mechanism by reducing the communication complexity within standard PBFT implementations to create the Accelerated Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (APBFT) consensus mechanism.\r\n\r\nToken Usage\r\n\u2022Through the CMCX token, users can conduct transactions on the CORE blockchain and pay for all utility fees within the ecosystem. Platform users can use the token to participate in governance, stake, transactions, smart contracts, and reward validators.\r\n\u2022Core\u2019s mission is to serve the community. Users can vote for management and developer teams using the native token CORE (CMCX). The CORE community provides projects funding. Users will vote on any proposed changes to the blockchain or platform, creating a community-driven blockchain.\r\n\u2022Through CORE, all blockchains, past and present, will be able to scale and communicate seamlessly with one another by utilizing the CMCX token. \r\n\r\n\r\nMulti-Layered framework design: \r\nCORE is constructed over three layers; ORIGO, CATENA & AURA. Each layer is designed perfectly to get the job done.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGO is the network layer. It is the brain of the system. It handles the formation of the blocks in the blockchain. \r\nCATENA is the blockchain layer and is built on the network layer. This is where the actual blocks form and newly formed blocks are appended.\r\nAURA is the application layer; this is where the DApps and smart contracts are built. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApeirogon blockchain framework\r\nCORE Blockchain combines all the latest frameworks and advanced programming languages into one cutting-edge solution to get more technical. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt is built on our in-house Apeirogon blockchain framework, a next-generation framework for enterprise-grade blockchain innovation that is highly compatible with Solidity.\r\nApeirogon is compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm), a super-performant virtual environment that provides a way to run code written in multiple languages on the web at near-native speed.\r\nApeirogon\u2019s ecosystem uses a state-of-the-art peer-to-peer network platform called LibP2P, a modular system of protocols, specifications, and libraries that enable the development of peer-to-peer network applications and is positioned to be the standard for future decentralized applications. \r\n\r\n\r\n Advantages\r\n\u2022Extensive research & value proposition to current blockchain limitations: The Whitepaper available on the Multi-chain website provides an in-depth yet accessible presentation of the responses provided by the team to solve current limitations on scalability, network efficiency, overall security, and reward fairness. CORE Multi-Chain Whitepaper accessible here.\r\n\u2022Security audits available: An audit of the network performed by CERTIK is currently public on the CORE Multi-Chain website.

From now on, when you want to share your crypto wisdom with the world, you're gonna be \"Xing.\" Feel the power of the \"X\" flowing through you as you spread knowledge and memes like a true crypto warrior!\r\n\r\nRemember those days when you were just a humble Twitterati? Forget about it! Now you're an X-er, and you belong to the one and only Crypto X community! \r\n\r\nBut wait, there's more! With Crypto X, your crypto lingo is getting an upgrade too! No more boring tweets; they're just old-school now. We've got \"X\" - the ultimate expression of crypto awesomeness! \r\n\r\n\"Hey, did you see that awesome X from Elon Musk?\"\r\n\"Yeah, man! He's the master of Xing!\"\r\nSee, it's catching on! \r\n\r\nCrypto X is all about having fun, sharing knowledge, and riding the wild crypto rollercoaster together. We've got the latest crypto news, epic price surges, and the occasional facepalm-worthy crashes. But you know what? We're in this together, and that's what makes the Crypto X community truly special!"}, "cryptyk": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2729/large/th.jpg?1667122361", "rank": null, "colors": ["#4374A2", "#A4B2C0"], "link": "https://cryptyk.io/", "description": "Cryptyk is building crypto powered cloud storage that offers users the first FAST, ultra-secure, private, decentralized file storage platform. Existing blockchain file storage technologies such as Filecoin and Storj are very secure ... but also very slow with access latencies of 10 seconds or more. This is not suitable for the vast majority of todays cloud storage applications that demand real-time performance (ie: access latency < 200 microseconds). The only application that blockchain storage is suitable for is for large file batch back-up which is a relatively small market < $300M / year. While decentralization dramatically improves security and privacy, storing files on the blockchain is simply to slow for most consumer and business markets.\r\n\r\nInstead of storing files on the blockchain Cryptyk stores files on a decentralized multi-cloud platform that offers 100x the security of centralized storage (eg: G Drive or iCloud) but without sacrificing access latency ((< 200 microseconds). Files are first encrypted, split into 5 separate file pieces and then each piece is encrypted a second time. Then each doubly encrypted file pieces is stores separately across the 5 major centralized storage providers in Google, Amazon, IBM, Oracle and Microsoft. Cryptyk then integrates this decentralized multi-cloud with a blockchain security auditing platform that permanently stores and tracks every user access event and file editing or sharing event on the blockchain. The blockchain security auditing platform is powered by Cryptyk Tokens (CTK) that are automatically  acquired by cloud storage users who pay in fiat (USD or Euro) with a portion converted into CTK Tokens to pay for security auditing functions. Hence CTK is a true utility token.\r\n\r\nThe result is a hybrid decentralized cloud design that offers the speed and scalability of the major centralized cloud vendors, the security and privacy of a 100% decentralized design, and the immutable permanence of blockchain for auditing and tracking capabilities. Cryptyk's crypto powered cloud storage platform represents the first decentralized technology that can truly compete head-on with centralized vendors like Google or Amazon."}, "csp-dao-network": {"link": "https://cspdao.network/"}, "csr": {"link": "https://csrnow.com/", "description": "CSR \"\"Plastic Credit\"\" is set to follow in the footsteps of the \u201cCarbon Credit\u201d.

Trusted layer 1 validator network built on the Tendermint protocol - Wasm compatibility, for smart contracts to be deployed on CUDOS using next-generation languages so long as they compile to WebAssembly. I.e. Golang, Rust, Java etc.\r\n\r\n2. Cross-chain or Horizontal interoperability thanks to the network\u2019s Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) integration, allowing Cudos Network smart contracts to interface with multiple networks.\r\n\r\n3. 10x lower transaction and gas costs compared to those on PoW networks - A massively scalable network to facilitate more sophisticated smart contract operations\r\n\r\n4. Higher performance with anywhere between 200 to 500 Peak TPS on the network - access to a globally distributed layer 3 network of secure cloud, and compute, resources\r\n\r\nTuring complete solutions for non-Turing complete Layer 1 blockchain networks. With the underlying Cudo platform live in over 145 countries, across enterprise and edge environments, and used by over 250,000 users, CUDOS is the next major release, providing a decentralised computing layer bridging on-chain and off-chain resources.\r\n\r\nThe CUDOS token serves the following clear purposes: Transaction payments, Network governance and operations, a staking mechanism for receiving blockchain and cloud workloads, and a medium of exchange (MoE). \r\n\r\nWhat is CUDOS trying to solve? \r\nScaling on blockchain is both expensive and limited in the type of use-cases it can support. CUDOS solves this issue by providing a highly scalable Layer 2 and 3 solution, connecting both on-chain and off-chain consumers to the network via smart contracts and APIs. \r\n\r\nWho are the founders at CUDOS?\r\nCUDOS was founded by Mathew Hawkins, an award-winning entrepreneur, who previously founded C4L, a data center, cloud and network infrastructure provider that grew to support 1% of the UK\u2019s internet infrastructure. Exiting in 2016 for $30m, Mathew started Cudo and the CUDOS network to build infrastructure services in software, what he previously achieved in hardware. The executive team have backgrounds in building and scaling and SaaS with COO Lee Woodham, who has over 25 years split across scaling financial services and tech companies. The board of advisors also includes David Juxon, former MD of Bank of America, Chris Deering, Former President of Sony Entertainment (Playstation), Joerg Roskowetz, Director of Blockchain for AMD and Maggie Fang, early investor in Uber and Alibaba. \r\n\r\nWhat makes CUDOS unique? \r\nCUDOS is the first decentralised computing network to provide services to both on-chain and off-chain infrastructure consumers. Built on the Cosmos blockchain and utilising the Tendermint protocol for secure BFT consensus, the CUDOS validator network will provide a globally distributed and highly secure network able to allocate more intensive workloads out to the underlying Layer 3 Cudo platform. \r\n\r\nHow is the CUDOS network secured? \r\nThe CUDOS Network utilises the Byzantine Fault Tolerant Bonded Proof of Stake mechanism featured in the Cosmos SDK, known as Tendermint Core, as its consensus engine. Validators in the CUDOS network stake a given amount of CUDOS in order to earn fees from validating transactions on the network in a secure and highly reliable way. In order to achieve this, the CUDOS Network also leverages the Cosmos SDK\u2019s staking, slashing, and governance modules to incentivise a minimum of 95% uptime and to swiftly eliminate validators known to perform double-signs or other known forms of bad actor behaviours. \r\n\r\nWho are the major partners of CUDOS?\r\nCUDOS is partnered with major and recognised brands across both blockchain and enterprise computing verticals, including AMD, Ultra & Algorand. Strategic backers include Outlier Ventures (OV), Moonwhale, Moonrock, Brilliance Ventures, GBV, Spincrypto, Double Peak, Coinvision, and BMW Capital. \r\n\r\nHow many CUDOS coins are there in circulation?\r\nThere is a maximum supply of 10 billion CUDOS tokens released over a 10 year period (starting from the 11th January 2021). The total supply of 10 billion CUDOS is distributed via multiple allocations, with 34% Ecosystem & Community Development, 33.78% Reserve, 20% Team (2% released based per milestone achieved. 10 key pre-determined milestones), 5% Advisors and 7.22% to presale token holders.

CyberVein is made to integrate the form of data economy in various aspects with the block chain technology as the core. Blockchain is the essence of a variety of technology integration into a State of a synchronous Machine (State Machine), using the characteristics of block chain technology to solve problems which cannot be solved in a traditional network. CyberVein also need to fully consider the model in the process of economics, architecture of applied mathematics, computer hardware and software technology. Its main purpose is to use the block chain technology to successfully serve the problem solving product/platform (BASS).\r\n\r\nThrough the analysis of the problems encountered in the design process of the existing blockchain technology, we also propose solutions to these problems. CyberVein is a underlying framework based on DAG and contains a programming language, the virtual machine, new smart contracts to build ecological chain system, the underlying blocks dedicated to and from the aspects of technical level and business level to solve the problem from the data value of the information age.\r\n\r\nThe business logic of CyberVein\r\n1. The value of passive data: passive data (such as Cookies) is not valuable in itself and only has the value to be exchanged.\r\n2. Definition of data exchange value: the exchange value of data needs to be defined by carrier and medium, which can be quantified to define data value and realize data transfer.\r\n3. The ownership of data: data is different from the ownership of the property rights and intellectual property rights. Data ownership is fundamentally to dominate the process of data, it can define the data owner distributing the data in detail, the capability of sharing, and delivered to the other party; At the same time, data ownership can also define the rights of data owners and tripartite users to create, edit, modify, share, and restrict access to data.\r\nThe three characteristics of CyberVein in the design of deep understanding and mining data can only improve the ecology of data value discovery.\r\n\r\nThe technical solutions of CyberVein\r\nCyberVein has the following technologies and innovative solutions proposed by multiple analysis to realize the design goal of CyberVein.\r\n1.A distributed ledger of DAG architecture.\r\n2.A smart contract programming language improved by CyberVein and a database virtual machine. \r\n3.A new consensus mechanism - PoC (Proof of Contribution)\r\n4.A new, inter-ecological smart contract architecture.\r\nOn the value of the data found in the process of using a DAG architecture of distributed books and a virtual machine with database functions, anyone can write the database and release smart contracts and Dapp, thus they can develop the data ownership of their value, data exchange format and data conversion function of rules.\r\n\r\nCyberVein programming language and virtual machine\r\nIn order to better achieve our smart contract outstanding performance, there are differences to the existing blockchain smart contracts. CyberVein will be in the development of the network at the same time, develop our own programming language Vein and Virtual Machine CBVM (CyberVein Virtual Machine). Vein language will take the Solidity as the foundation, at the same time, to improve the running mechanism with the help of some rich libraries about database operations, realize functions such as definition method call price. \r\nVein language will help in the existing smart contract writers blockchain migration, and CyberVein will release documents to help developers get started faster.\r\nCBVM defines the data value in ecological and metastasis, and provide safe and reliable high-performance smart contracts running environment. CyberVein virtual machine in addition to used to run the smart contract, will also be a database operation system. Unlike traditional database, the database in CBVM sandbox is more like a database, and the operation of each node of the virtual machine will have independent sandbox, ensure data or use condition does not affect chain is affected.\r\n\r\nCyberVein new consensus algorithm: Proof of Contribution\r\nCyberVein, like all blockchain technology, is driven by motivation of safe mode. In the traditional blockchain mining consensus, it is based on the choice of total difficulty of highest blocks. Miners and others to the blocks. In most of the consensus standards, only containing a given difficulty of work experience (PoW) of blocks are valid.\r\nThere\u2019s no mining mechanism in the DAG architecture because there is no miner concept. However, the existing DAG in the project before the release unit verification, most are using PoW and CyberVein will use our PoC mechanism is put forward.\r\nCyberVein contribution to prove: a response to block in the chain of the abuse of power or force concentrated and algorithm. PoC is based on the user's contribution to the network, add the appropriate hash calculation, to determine whether can win in the competition mechanism in the network. In traditional blockchain PoC can be used in the process of mining.\r\nIn each have the same hash miners work force, contribute more to the network resources miners (such as he contributed more hard disk capacity, or bandwidth, or power, etc.) will have smaller hash difficulty, so as to have more chance to beat competitors in the probability, acquired the right to the manufacture of new blocks.\r\nIn the DAG, when a user has more units under the condition of (he contributed more hard disk storage unit in the network), it will be more likely to reference the existing units, and obtain the corresponding fees.\r\nIOTA and Byteball projects in PoW validation of the role is mainly used to prevent the witch attacks and network to some extent abuse problems, and we believe that the use of PoC and other mechanisms, and can be done at the same time, encourage more users to participate in and contribution to the attack of prevention effect."}, "cybria": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/31694/large/Cybria_Logo_200x200.png?1694502683", "rank": null, "colors": ["#050506", "#676768"], "link": "https://www.cybria.io/", "description": "What is the project about?\r\nCybria is a new Layer 2 Blockchain project.\r\nCybria built on top of the Ethereum network.

Limit order - user chooses the parameters (price, term). Market order - the user buys/sells what is available in the trading terminal. \r\n\u25cf 2-level system of commissions. Maker fee - if the user adds liquidity to the order book (puts an order not at the current market), a reduced commission is applied to it.

By using delta.theta LITE, in 3 clicks any farmer can qualitatively increase his APY by choosing a simple ready-made risk management scheme. Our product solves two major pains of \"farmers\":\u00a0\r\n\r\n1. First, through delta.theta, farmers buy protection during the farming period. The farmer invests in stablecoins and \"strong\" coins (ETH, e.t.c.), and the output is a coin that is subject to a significant drop. Thus, the farmer needs to get protection from the dump of the token that is being farmed. \r\n2. Efficient capital management. Today's farmers in search of APY growth use quite a wide range of products, from simple farming to flashloans solutions. Options allow them to participate with less capital leverage. We started out with a simple one - by allowing farmers to sell options. You sell an option - and you make money. \r\n\r\nThe farmer has an opportunity to make money on his desire to use his own capital more efficiently. Example: A farmer wants to sell a coin at a higher price and comes to delta.theta, he uses the Sell High option and places a limit order through the delta.theta LITE app and the magic begins: a. first, his order can go into LIP (disabling feature) - this means that his order is deposited on the Venus protocol and the farmer is paid the appropriate APY b. Secondly, if the buyer bought the farmer's option, he paid him a premium. But the option may not be executed. So, the farmer has already earned in 2 places just on his desire to be efficient."}, "delysium": {"link": "https://www.delysium.com", "description": "Delysium is building AI-powered virtual society with $AGI.

The founder of the decentralized hedge fund can only swap / trade with user funds, while withdrawals and payouts are automated by smart contracts, therefore eliminating the possibility of scam or pyramid schemes.\r\nThe platform will also enable users to participate in direct p2p lending, where every user sets the loan amount, interest rate, loan duration, and collateral requirement, which can be even under or over 100% allowing for under and over collateralized loans. Every borrower on the platform will have a credit rating, and lenders can set the minimum credit rating required to take the loan, and even set different collateral requirements and interest rates for users with different credit ratings. If someone never got liquidated on their loan aka never defaulted and always paid back the loan amount + interest on time, they will have a very high credit rating, while users who get liquidated / default many times will see their credit rating slip down. Credit rating can be improved or worsened over time. \r\nThe platform will also have a secondary marketplace for synthetic assets where users can buy and sell the loans, therefore allowing lenders to exit their positions and delegate the risk and waiting time to other users. So for example, if a user is lending a loan with a 10% interest rate, but they need money / liquidity urgently or they simply don\u2019t want to wait until the end of the loan duration, they can instead decide to sell their loan, and maybe someone will buy it for 4% instantly, which would mean a 6% profit for them after they receive the original 10% interest at the end of the loan\u2019s duration, which is beneficial for both a buyer and the seller. For the seller (the original lender), they don\u2019t have to wait and they are getting a smaller profit with no risk, and for the buyer of the loan, they are receiving a higher profit for waiting until the end of the loan\u2019s duration.

These districts are built upon a decentralized and distributed open-source framework, the d0xINFRA network, which is powered by Ethereum smart contracts. The district0x network aims at creating a friction-free, virtual economy where the users will be able to make buying and selling decisions, complete transactions, and even rank their peers with just one simple click. District0x aims to develop a flexible, and free market with advanced entrepreneurial concepts.\r\n\r\nThe District0x infrastructure has a very neat concept with some well-outlined features, such as the staking interface. A staking interface is put in place that allows DNT holders to have open control over the districts through an Aragon governance layer for all markets that come online. Post creation of a district, an Aragon entity will also be created that people can use to interact with this staking mechanism. After staking a user will receive voting rights in that district.  Using the creation interface, one can remove central power structures from any marketplace without the additional need for development or programming skills. It can be described as the WordPress of dApps where the districts being launched are like wordpress templates and the auxiliary modules are WordPress plugins for extended functionality.\r\n\r\nWhile it is very difficult to buy lesser known cryptocurrencies using fiat currencies (dollars, euros) directly from crypto-exchanges, district0x or DNT can be easily purchased from various exchanges using <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> as the base cryptocoin. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance\">Binance</a> is one of the popular exchange platforms that can help trade Bitcoin or Ethereum for District0x. One can use various wallets like myetherwallet.com to store the district0x (DNT) coins. Coinbase, Blockchain, Exodus, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/trezor-model-t-wallet-review?locale=en\">Trezor Hardware Wallet</a> are also wallets that supports district0x.\r\n\r\nDistrict0x, differs from most coins in its underlying concept and the architecture it is built on. The concept of interconnected districts and marketplaces promises a novel structure to the modern economies. What a lot of users are missing out on is the fact that it is a staking mechanism and not just a voting token. Staking is basically the process of mining the PoS (proof of stake) coins. Early investors will be able to lock their tokens to a specific district on the network, thus being able to participate in its governance later. DNT tokens can be staked in districts, thus they not only give voting power and privileges within that district but also provide district-specific tokens depending on when the investor had started trading. For example, early investors of the PoS token will be able to make decisions about the distribution of profits among stakeholders, the intricacies of the business model etc. DNT can basically be considered as a dynamic stock in the future district0x ecosystem.\r\n\r\nBy joining the district0x, the user receives district0x coins. They allow the owner to exercise the right to vote for district proposals and make decisions within certain districts. This includes, for example, voting on proposals concerning the future of a particular district or setting fees. The scope of shareholders\u2019 rights is outlined in the bylaws and varies according to the specific scope and purpose of each district. District0x platform users can interact with the functions and services provided by each district. Users can also freely create their own districts. For example, on Ethlance, the first district in the District0x network, users can post job offers or search for new jobs."}, "diva-protocol": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/31467/large/DIVA-200px-square.png?1692950670", "rank": null, "colors": ["#414146", "#AFAFB2"], "link": "https://www.divaprotocol.io/", "description": "What is the project about?\r\nDIVA Protocol is a highly versatile smart contract-based system for creating and managing derivative financial contracts peer-to-peer.\r\n\r\nWhat makes your project unique?\r\nDIVA Protocol distinguishes itself from peers like Augur, Polymarket, and Opyn in several key ways:\r\n- High customization: DIVA Protocol offers unmatched customization, allowing users to select virtually any metric as the underlying and choose from a wide range of payoff profiles.\r\n- Compliance layer: DIVA Protocol is one of the first DeFi protocols that implements a compliance feature to enable traditional financial institutions to use DIVA Protocol while complying with existing KYC and AML regulations.\r\n- Gas optimized: DIVA Protocol implements an efficient off-chain matching mechanism with an on-chain settlement process leveraging the EIP712 signature standard, thereby optimizing gas usage by creating the derivative contract on-chain only when a counterparty is found.\r\n- Composable: DIVA Protocol harnesses the true power of decentralized finance by prioritizing composability.

This allows creators to reduce their pricing, leading to a net benefit to both sides of the exchange and creates a more open transparent market than current solutions. Content will be accompanied by a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) which corresponds to that specific piece of content. The NFT will provide proof of ownership which is validated by participants on the network so there can be no dispute over who owns the rights to said content. The functionality of NFT\u2019s gives the content creator the control to either sell complete ownership rights, rights to one in a limited collection or single rights to one of many.\r\n\r\nThe Envision platform will be powered by VIS which is Envisions fungible ERC20 utility token. VIS tokens are the exclusive form of payment on the ENVISION marketplace where consumers exchange VIS tokens for the NFT associated with a piece of stock media directly with the content creator. VIS tokens are also used to distribute rewards, fund the platform and incentivise platform participants/token holders."}, "envoy-network": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/19631/large/env.png?1638148461", "rank": null, "colors": ["#9359FE", "#BD5FFC"], "link": "https://envoy.art/", "description": "A new era in collectibles.

Taking ETH as an example, users can choose to hold high-volatility ETHC (ETH Coin) assets and low-volatility ETHS (ETH Stable) assets based on their risk preferences. This offers users the flexibility to choose based on their risk tolerances. Moreover, the protocol offers a powerful hedge against ETH price shifts, allowing users to open low-cost long positions on ETH with low liquidation risk.\r\n\r\nWhat makes your project unique?\r\nMori stands out with its unique approach, including the introduction of LSD support. It not only meets the demand for a trusted stable asset but also develop various applications for its' high volatility ETHC token, expanding its utility and potential use cases.

The second round of token offering on August 10th, raising 174 ETH within a remarkably brief 35-second span. The project's alpha mainnet was introduced on August 13th. Moreover, the community has observed substantial and organic growth, primarily composed of dedicated enthusiasts.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s next for your project?\r\nThe upcoming stages of our project entail diverse endeavors. We plan to have our token listed on decentralized exchanges, facilitating direct trading, and also partake in the competitive landscape of yield optimization, possibly on platforms like Curve Finance. Furthermore, we aim to go live on Layer 2 scaling solutions(integrate with layerzero), optimizing efficiency. We're exploring cross-chain capabilities, aiming to function across multiple blockchain ecosystems, and considering the creation of derivatives tied to core assets like ETHS and ETHS.\r\n\r\nWhat can your token be used for?\r\nETHC is designed to absorb the main volatility of ETH, so it can be seen as a leveraged derivative of ETH.

As a DeFi protocol, Lybra facilitates the minting of eUSD by allowing users to borrow against their deposited ETH and stETH.\r\n\r\neUSD, being an ETH-assets-over-collateralized stablecoin, offers users the security and stability necessary for conducting their business with confidence.\r\n\r\nA distinctive feature of the Lybra Protocol is that users can earn regular stable income by holding minted (borrowed) eUSD, which is powered by the LSD (Liquid Staking Derivatives) income generated from the deposited ETH and stETH. In other words, when users deposit ETH or stETH and mint EUSD against them, they receive a stable income in stETH of approximately 5%, which is converted to eUSD through the protocol and distributed to them.\r\n\r\neUSD is an interest-bearing, over-collateralized stablecoin that ensures safety and stability. The Lybra Foundation and LybraDAO community firmly believe that a decentralized stablecoin is essential for both enterprises and individuals to fully harness the benefits of cryptocurrency.

However, Farmer Moe is set to change that by developing a protocol that is user-friendly and designed for mass adoption. This whitepaper outlines Farmer Moe's roadmap and community incentives, highlighting its vision to revolutionize the GameFi and LSDfi sectors.\r\nIntroduction: Blockchain technology has revolutionized various industries, including finance and gaming. GameFi, the fusion of gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi), has gained immense popularity by offering users the ability to earn rewards and create value through gaming activities. Additionally, Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) have provided users with the flexibility to trade staked assets and access liquidity while participating in proof-of-stake blockchain networks. Farmer Moe aims to bring these two concepts together to create MoeFi, a novel approach to tokenization.\r\nMoeFi - The Vision: Farmer Moe's vision is to simplify and democratize the world of Liquid Staking Derivatives and GameFi. By combining the benefits of both sectors, MoeFi offers users the opportunity for high returns and long-term value while ensuring a user-friendly experience. Farmer Moe aims to make LSD/LSDfi accessible to the masses and redefine the way users engage with these technologies.\r\nRoadmap: Farmer Moe will follow a carefully planned roadmap to ensure a gradual and secure deployment of its protocol. The initial launch will introduce basic LSD farms and a $MOE staking farm. These farms will allow users to stake their assets and earn rewards within the protocol. As the project progresses, Farmer Moe will develop an aggregated dynamic LSD farm.

Once FORT is staked, it may only be withdrawn subject to a thawing period, which provides ample opportunity for verification and dispute resolution. Active node operators may earn rewards in FORT from the Network if they maintain the minimum stake and emit alerts and execute their assigned work correctly.\r\n\r\n2) Delegated staking: FORT holders have the possibility to delegate to scan node pools. This action improves the security of the network and enables delegators to participate in the rewards distribution. \r\n\r\n3) Minimum Bot Stake Requirement.

Fusion uses the Hierarchical Hybrid Consensus Mechanism (HHCM) that borrows things from PoW and PoS. At the same time, it uses a parallel computing by grouping nodes together, creating an efficient and safe platform.\r\n\r\nThe Fusion team used in its whitepaper the term Internet of Values which refers mostly to cryptocurrency related matters, such as the exchange and management of digital assets securely and without intermediaries. The Distributed Control Right Management is a security layer that protects all locked-in cryptocurrency assets on the Fusion blockchain. The distributed storage and sharding of a private key ensures that no one can have access the complete private key, meaning that no single node can gain control of the digital assets. Along with the traditional transaction triggering mechanism, FUSION incorporated time and event based triggers into its smart contracts. These three triggering modes have resulted from various financial situations, and have been designed to meet the requests of complex financial smart contracts.\r\n\r\nBitSE, the company behind the Fusion Project, was founded in 2013 by Dejun Qian, being also responsible for the creation of QTUM and VeChain. QTUM and VeChain are both blockchain foundations which developed into independent ventures. The native token of the Fusion platform, FSN, will be used in paying network fees. Smart contracts require FSN in order for them to be executed, much like how ETH is used in the Ethereum network.

To do so, GAMB uses a proprietary parallel chain system by creating a \u201cclone\u201d coin (GMBT) on the SkyFiber blockchain, to its publicly traded ECR-20 parent token (GMB). GMB and its parallel clone are the native tokens of GLMall. This revolutionary and patent-pending parallel token solution allows crypto payments without any blockchain-related transfer or gas fees and is the key to implementing crypto payments in daily e-commerce. \r\n\r\nWhy should I buy GMB?\r\nBy being a GMB holder you will be part of the first decentralized online marketplace operating in the real world and the metaverse. GMB is easily swappable into its parallel coin GMBT which can be used to purchase goods or services on the marketplace without any fees. \r\n\r\nHow many GMB are in circulation?\r\nAll of 5.000.000.000 GMB created have been created and issued, along with the same number of clone tokens GMBT.\r\n\r\nWhat makes GMB so unique?\r\nGAMB\u2019s unique parallel chain solution allows transactions to be completely free, infinitely scalable. For any one active GMBT coin used for transactions on the marketplace (i.e., within the SkyFiber blockchain), one GMB token is locked on the ETH blockchain until a re-swap occurs. This directly limiting impact on GMB liquidity on the ETH blockchain, created through the increased utilization of the GMBT on the Marketplace, forms an organically value-driving token economy. \r\n\r\nWhat is the technical basis of GMB/GMBT?\r\nGMB is an ECR 20 Token and a licensed utility token. Its parallel clone GMBT's is built on the Skyfiber blockchain using its unique consensus algorithm called \"\"Obelisk\"\". Obelisk consensus mechanism uses a PoT (Proof-of-Trust) consensus algorithm which establishes a unique validation mechanism modeled on a 'web of trust' topography and distributing influence across the network in a manner reminiscent of human social dynamics. Every node has a list of trusted nodes to which it subscribes to and the more subscribers a node has, the more influence it has on the network. Due to the transparent and public nature of the decisions and trust lists located on each node's individual blockchain, a misbehaving node can easily be identified and isolated by the community as nodes will simply remove the malicious node from their trust list, causing the node's influence to decrease. This mechanism allows the community to shift the balance of power on the network rapidly which brings about a highly democratic and decentralized decisioning process.\r\n\r\nWhere can I buy GMB?\r\nGMB tokens can be purchased on most KuCoin, Coinsbit & Azbit and provides four trading pairs BTC, ETH, BNB, USDT.\r\n\r\nMost recent articles about GAMB:\r\nhttps://www.glbrain.com/index.php?r=content/view&id=40813\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSDIqmoFcuo&t=1279s \r\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/first-cinematic-nft-film-series-135800667.html?soc_src=social-sh&soc_trk=tw&tsrc=twtr \r\n"}, "gambler-shiba": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/17130/large/RHzOHCyb_400x400.jpg?1626410775", "rank": null, "colors": ["#E00C12", "#E5A76B"], "link": "", "description": "Gambler Shiba (GSHIBA) is The first perfect gambling token to give fair rewards to holders based on their commitment to GSHIBA.\r\n\r\nWe provide a tiered gambling system, the higher tier you're in, the more rewards, you get.

Hedron also allows stakers to trade their HEX stakes as NFT tokens on any compatible NFT marketplace. Hedron has no admin keys and no kill switches. Just like HEX, Hedron is completely decentralized with zero counterparty risk.\r\n\r\nHow do i get HDRN? Hedron analyzes a HEX stake and allows the staker to mint or borrow HDRN based on the amount of shares allocated to their stakes. If a staker emergency unstakes or otherwise ends their stake before minting their HDRN, they will no longer be able to mint HDRN against those stakes. Instanced (HSI) HEX stakes with active HDRN advances cannot End Stake until the advance is paid in full (Good Accounting can still be used).The maximum amount of mintable or borrowable days is equal to the full term of the stake.\r\n\r\nHow does HDRN supply relate to the HEX share price?

Its primary focus is to provide advanced technology and services to the DeFi ecosystem, ensuring a seamless user experience, and unlocking the full potential of decentralised finance.\r\n\r\n### What makes your Kei Finance unique?\r\n\r\nKei Finance has many unique features built inside the protocol. One such feature is the concept of a \"Minimum Total Supply,\" which ensures that the protocol only mints the exact amount of tokens required to launch. This approach allows the protocol to manage supply in a way that promotes stable growth over time. Additionally, Kei Finance boasts a treasury-backed floor price, which ensures that if the token price ever falls below a certain point, the treasury will automatically buy tokens back to maintain the price above a certain threshold.\r\n\r\nKei Finance also offers a distinctive reward distribution mechanism that powers the growth of the protocol. This process sends rewards to different parts of the protocol, such as stakers, administrators and affiliates. It also uses these rewards for debt repayment, to increase liquidity and raise the floor price. Furthermore, Kei Finance has an inbuilt affiliate system, allowing anyone to earn rewards on the blockchain simply by bringing customers to the platform.\r\n\r\nIn terms of staking, Kei Finance offers a range of unique features. The first is staking NFTs, which provide real-time statistics on stake progress and can be traded on opensea and transferred freely. The second is the ability to combine auto-compounding and reward multiplier mechanisms, providing users with an easy way to maximize their returns on their staked assets. \r\n\r\n### History of Kei Finance.\r\n\r\nKei Finance has been in development since the beginning of 2022, during which time the contracts have undergone a comprehensive testing and simulation process to ensure the protocol delivers on its promises. The team behind Kei Finance recognized the limitations of traditional DeFi applications and services, and created a platform that aims to lead the charge in smart contract and blockchain technology. They achieve this through the innovative architecture and design of the system itself, which addresses the pain points that users face when interacting with other DeFi protocols. By creating a new standard in DeFi, Kei Finance is setting itself up for success as a platform that prioritizes innovation, reliability, and user experience.\r\n\r\n### What\u2019s next for Kei Finance?\r\n\r\nKei Finance has an exciting roadmap ahead, with plans to roll out a range of cutting-edge technologies that will seamlessly integrate into its existing protocol and reward distribution mechanisms. Among these plans are the creation of decentralized borrowing and lending services, as well as automated asset management systems that provide users with greater control and flexibility. In addition, Kei Finance is exploring secure payment transfer systems, which will further enhance the user experience and make it even easier to pay for services on the blockchain.\r\n\r\n### What can KEI be used for?\r\n\r\nThe KEI token serves as the backbone of the protocol and its various services. All distribution mechanisms within the protocol run on the power of the KEI token, and this will continue to be the case for future services. Additionally, the KEI token can be staked within the protocol to create sKEI tokens, which grant the ability to participate in governance proposals through voting. In short, the KEI token has a dual purpose, powering the protocol and enabling community participation in its development."}, "kek": {"link": "https://www.kingdomofkek.com/", "description": "Introducing KEK, the ultimate crypto meme project that combines the power of the ancient Egyptian god Kek with the modern online meme culture.

As a decentralized scalable layer 1 chain based on patented technologies, Locus Chain aims to support various Defi, GameFi, Metaverse, Smart City, CBDC(Central Bank Digital Currency) projects by being the most reliable, secure, low cost and high performance layer 1 public blockchain platform. Locus Chain claims to be the first decentralized Layer 1 public blockchain to ever solve the blockchain trilemma of Decentralization. Scalability and Security.\r\n\r\nLOCUS token?\r\nThe current Locus token type before the mainnet is an Ethereum-based ERC20 token with smart contract issued by Locus Chain Foundation. However, given that the tokens on the public Ethereum network cannot be used on the Locus Chain directly, we will be making use of hashed time-locked contracts to allow 1-to-1 atomic swaps of Locus tokens from Ethereum to the Locus Chain mainnet. LOCUS will be the main cryptocurrency required for all the operations of the Locus Chain network and all of its applications. LOCUS is a payment method for the entire network economy. Tokens are used by validators (who can easily participate), developers, and users to participate in the LOCUS network and receive rewards. It is also used to for fees and to participate in future governance.\r\n\r\nLOCUS Ecosystem\r\nTop developers and high profile business partners are participating in the development of Locus Chain one after another. High-performance Layer 1 blockchain can create various business opportunities in sectors including decentralized finance, real estate transaction platforms, and game money, etc as well as creating various other tokens. In addition, Locus Chain allows the users to use the blockchain verification service through a simple linkage without building a separate blockchain. Since it is a high-performance public blockchain platform, technology licensing will be carried out in the future in the areas of CBDC and IOT, including smart cities, smart factories, and smart grids based on vast amounts of data.\r\n\r\nSpecial technology of LOCUS\r\n*DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph) - AWTC(Account-Wise Transaction Chain)\r\n\r\nThe AWTC, Account-Wise-Transaction-Chain, is a central data structure for Locus Chain's high capacity, distributed transaction processing. AWTC is a Directed-Acyclic-Graph (DAG) based data structure composed of multiple transaction chains, each for an account. Each account has its dedicated chain. A new transaction issued by an account is primarily added to the account's chain. Block grid structures, including DAG-AWTC, do not cause conflicts because there are as many points as the number of accounts to which the transaction is added, and only the owning account can record it exclusively. Also, the account that added the transaction becomes clear, so if the account holder himself is not a malicious user, the transaction is almost confirmed as soon as it is added. The ledger structure of the Locus Chain is one of the main technical features to fundamentally solve the problem of delayed transaction processing that the existing blockchains had.\r\n\r\nPOS - BFT Consensus Algorithm\r\nGiven the time required for the data to propagate sufficiently to the network, the Locus Chain first implemented a BFT definitive consensus on the DAG by attempting to consent on a small amount of historical points of time. It also selects a new proposer committee that participates in the consensus algorithm every round by a random verifiable function (VRF) based on stochastic PoS (proof of stake: the more shares, the higher the probability of being elected as a committee). Since these methods cannot identify or predict the nodes (proposer, validator) to participate in the consensus, manipulation by malicious attacks is difficult, ensuring fairness and network stability of the consensus results.\r\n*Verifiable Pruning\r\n\r\nUnlike traditional pruning, which reduces the size of a ledger by simply deleting old data to address growing ledger sizes, Locus Chain's Verifiable Pruninng uses a Skewed Merkle Tree structure to validate the legitimacy of the data even when most of the previous data is deleted in the local environment. Verifiable pruning deletes outdated data on the ledger while still being able to provide full data verification by verifying previous data with hash values.\r\n\r\n*Dynamic Sharding\r\n\r\nLocus Chain has a ledger structure formed of each account (AWTC), making it easy to adjust the number and size of the shard, and the validator ratio by relocating the shard in the event of an imbalance between shards. With dynamic sharding, the network usage that a node has to cover is reduced to 2/N when the number of shards is N.

In other words, when users deposit ETH or stETH and mint EUSD against them, they receive a stable income in stETH of approximately 5%, which is converted to eUSD through the protocol and distributed to them.\r\n\r\neUSD is an interest-bearing, over-collateralized stablecoin that ensures safety and stability.

This innovative mechanism ensures that with every buy or sell, 2% of the transaction's value in SHIBA INU tokens is burned. As the governance token of Marswap DEX, operating on the Shibarium Chain, $MSWAP serves a vital role within the Marswap ecosystem. Marswap's primary objective is to evolve into a comprehensive DeFi hub, catering to a wide array of projects by offering tailored solutions. The token's total supply is capped at 1 trillion units, creating a controlled and calculated ecosystem.\r\n\r\nWhat Makes MSWAP Unique?\r\nThe uniqueness of $MSWAP lies in its innovative tokenomics and its direct impact on SHIBA INU tokens. The burning mechanism, where 2% of SHIBA INU tokens are eradicated in each transaction, fosters a deflationary environment, potentially influencing the token's scarcity and value over time. This distinctive approach aligns with Marswap's vision to become a versatile DeFi platform for diverse projects, offering customized solutions that can set it apart from other tokens and projects in the space.\r\n\r\nHistory of MSWAP\r\nThe journey of $MSWAP began with a vision to address inefficiencies in the DeFi landscape. It stemmed from the need to create a platform that caters to various crypto projects, offering them tailor-made solutions to their unique challenges. The burning mechanism was introduced as an ingenious way to establish a connection between $MSWAP and SHIBA INU, enhancing the token's significance within the larger crypto ecosystem. Over time, $MSWAP has grown to become the governance token of Marswap DEX on the Shibarium Chain, solidifying its role in shaping the future of DeFi.\r\n\r\nWhat's Next for MSWAP?\r\nThe trajectory of $MSWAP is set to be dynamic and transformative. The team behind Marswap envisions the token evolving into the go-to destination for DeFi solutions for an array of crypto projects. With its unique burning mechanism and governance features, $MSWAP aims to establish itself as a significant player in the DeFi space, fostering innovation and collaboration across different blockchain projects. As the DeFi ecosystem continues to expand, $MSWAP intends to remain adaptable, offering innovative solutions that cater to the ever-changing needs of the crypto community.\r\n\r\nWhat Can MSWAP Be Used For?\r\n$MSWAP serves multiple purposes within the Marswap ecosystem. It acts as a governance token, allowing token holders to participate in decision-making processes that shape the development and direction of Marswap DEX. Additionally, the burning mechanism associated with $MSWAP creates potential value accrual for holders over time, thanks to the reduction in the supply of SHIBA INU tokens. As Marswap aims to provide tailored DeFi solutions, $MSWAP can be utilized to access various services, features, and opportunities offered by the platform.

It is a system that rewards users who engage in \u201csocial mining\u201d. Mithril rewards users for the impact their content may have in viewers and the popularity it attracts, such as number of likes and views.  In the blockchain network and cryptocurrency, Mithril is a very innovative idea that aims to change the way we think about social media entirely. This particular innovation will decentralize and reward social media content creators in a fair and open way.The process of building a social media platform from the scratch is a long, rigorous and exhausting one. Even though blockchain based social media platforms are not new innovations, they usually cannot interact with existing platforms. The Mithril integration protocol permits MITH mining on all social media networks. Therefore, Mithril can also leverage existing sites for their own purposes. In addition, it permits content influencers to make use of their pre-existing followers network to mine Mithril. This acts as a big plus to the Mithril ecosystem. It requires less stress and work than establishing followers on an entirely new platform. It also helps Mithril to have an edge and a bigger pool of users. This means that, content providers only need to start making use of the Mithril integration protocol in order to make more money.\r\n\r\nInstead of an ICO, Mithril held a private crowdsale where 400,000,000 MITH was distributed and 50,000,000 was retained by the Mithril team for development and marketing. Mithril MITH tokens are mined by participating on partner applications and this social mining is a gamechanger. Creating and sharing content earns Mithril MITH, which can then be spent with partner applications. Because mythril is a crafting ingredient in the Final Fantasy video game series, online searches for how to spend MITH have these pages mixed in, which will likely continue for several years until the platform gains enough big-name retail spending partners to rise up SEO rankings.\r\n\r\nMITH is currently available on Bithumb and OKEx, but more exchanges will likely list the token soon. Although exchanges are never the best place to store your cryptocurrencies due to security concerns, this is one possibility. Better would be to store them using an ERC-20 wallet that allows you to add custom tokens, such as MyEtherWallet, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/how-to-use-mycrypto-desktop-app?locale=en\">MyCrypto</a>, or Coinfy.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Mithril platform and its flagship social network Lit are still in fairly early development, as an early mover, they are poised to be a leader in the decentralized social networking space. If Mithril gets its way, centralized social networking companies may soon have worthy competitors that offer users more control of their data while rewarding people for creating the content that is ultimately the life-blood of all social networks."}, "mithril-share": {"link": "https://mith.cash/"}, "mixaverse": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/31471/large/IMG_20230824_191015_871.png?1692952031", "rank": null, "colors": ["#343020", "#E8CA59"], "link": "https://mixaverse.one/", "description": "What is the project about?\r\nMixaverse is a Layer2 multi-chain metaverse platform that empowering a sustainable metaverse economy with Mixa-NFTs, Mixa-Coin, and Mixa-Land.\r\n\r\nWhat makes your project unique?\r\nMixa-NFT is a digital image based on blockchain technology.

The reward is distributed to a pool of \u201cendorsers\u201d or \u201cadvocates\u201d in proportion to each token holder's respective endorsement allocation amount, in NFTY tokens, to auctions on NFT exchanges which support the protocol. \r\n\r\nThis incentive gives the participants the challenge of defining the best strategy to \u201cendorse\u201d auctions based on their ability to close the sale, possible amount of the final payout, quality of the NFT being auctioned, and the number of other advocates currently endorsing the auction. The reward is distributed proportionally to the social power of all advocates: i.e. if Person A allocates 10 NFTY to an auction and Person B allocates 20 NFTY to it, Person A gets 1/3 of the 7.5% advocacy reward. During an auction's bidding period, allocated NFTY tokens are locked and unable to be unstaked until after that auction is completed and the NFT is sold, at which point allocated NFTY tokens are unlocked for reallocation or unstaking.\r\n\r\nThis creates a multitude of possible strategies without incentivizing the endorsement of non-sellable, low-quality, or fraudulent products and spammy content as doing so is not economically viable.

Each token is also convertible into an NFT at a rate of 1:1. Hence, it is a token with JPEG metadata that is designed to be traded both on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap (as an ERC20) and on NFT marketplaces (as an ERC1155). \r\n\r\nThis unique design\u2014an NFT that can also be traded as an ERC20\u2014is called a meme fungible token (MFT). An MFT like Non-Playable Coin (NPC) links two often-separated liquidity markets, while also allowing more people than ever to own a \"part of the culture\" as NFTs. \r\n\r\nOn the home page, users can switch between the two formats using the dApp. Users can \"respawn\" as an NFT or \"transform\" into a meme coin. The most liquid form for trading, however, is as an ERC20.\r\n\r\nHistory of your project.\r\nThe project started by playing with NFT AMMs like Sudoswap and realizing that ERC1155s were not being used to explore new avenues. We also felt that the 10k+ pfp NFT collection has hit a wall because it is limited both by exclusivity and gas cost. This project seeks to demonstrate that it is possible to scale communities to millions using the ERC1155 standard, and that it is possible to unlock liquidity for such tokens by making them fungible as an ERC20. \r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s next for your project?\r\nUsers will soon be able to accessorize their NPCs using a built-in customization tool and export their creations to be used as profile photos. Additionally, we are constructing new supporting infrastructure to better link the liquidity of ERC20 tokens with ERC1155 tokens, with NPC as the main showcase.\r\n\r\nWhat can your token be used for?\r\nAt its core, it is purely a meme coin with no utility and is for entertainment purposes only.

ONE holders will receive 100 percent of trading fee on BigONE\u2019s platform.\r\n\r\nONE is divided into two parts:\r\n\r\nCommunity-owned\r\n51% of all ONEs belong to community. The total amount is 10.2 billion. Once mined/released, these ONE tokens can circulate on BigONE.\r\n\r\nBIG token holders owned\r\n49% of all ONEs belong to existing BIG token holders. Total amount of this part is 9.8 billion ONEs, and will be released at the same rate as the community-owned part in proportion. These ONEs will be airdropped to all BIG token holders every day. However, these ONEs airdropped to BIG holders will be frozen till June 21st, 2022 UTC+8, and cannot be circulated on the BigONE trading platform or other platforms during this period.\r\n\r\nTrade cryptos in the \u201cTrade-Mining\u201d section, and get your trading fee rebated in ONEs of the equivalent value.\r\nRefer new users to complete registration, pass identity verification (KYC) on BigONE, and start trading in the \u201cTrade-Mining\u201d section.

All trading fee occurred on the platform during the past 24 hours will be airdropped to all ONE holders in the form of a number of crypto assets received by the platform. Allocation formula = number of ONE held / total number of ONE released\r\n\r\nAll ONEs are locked until mined, and will be gradually mined through \u201cTrade-Mining\u201d or \u201cReferral-Mining\u201d or \u201cAirdrop to BIG token holders\u201d until 20 billion ONEs are all mined.\r\n\r\n\u3010Trade-Mining\u3011\r\n\r\nTrade-Mining can only be achieved by trading crypto assets in the \u201cTrade-Mining\u201d section.

On the following day\u2019s 10:00 UTC+8, the trading platform will rebate these unlocked ONEs to users / miners who traded in the \u201cTrade-mining\u201d section in the previous day.\r\n\r\n\u3010Referral-Mining\u3011\r\n\r\nReferral-mining is the incentive mechanism for the platform\u2019s existing users to invite new users to sign up BigONE. Every midnight (or 00:00 UTC+8), the trading platform will calculate the total trading fee from your referred new users\u2019 tradings on the previous day (from 00:00 AM to 24:00 PM UTC+8) to the equivalent value of ONEs. BigONE will rebate 20% of your referred new user\u2019s trading fee to you in ONE tokens. Such incentive will be given to you on the same day at 10:00 AM UTC+8.\r\n\r\nNote: The ONEs that are referral-mined are released in addition to the regular trade-mined portion, thus BIG token holders will also receive their equivalent proportion of referral-mined ONEs airdropped.\r\n\r\n\u3010Airdrop ONEs to BIG Token Holders\u3011\r\n\r\nEvery midnight (24:00 PM UTC+8) the platform will take a snapshot of the balance of BIG tokens, and airdrop mined ONEs to BIG holders\u2019 according to the formula: [Previous day\u2019s number of unlocked ONEs in the Community-owned part] / 51 x 49]. However, these ONEs given to BIG holders will be frozen until June 21st, 2022, and cannot be circulated on trading platform during this period, but the platform rebates continue to apply.\r\n\r\n\u3010Friendly Tips\u3011\r\n\r\nAs soon as the new \u201cTrade-mining\u201d rule applies and 100% of BigONE's revenue (trading fee) is rebated to ONE holders gradually, the previous BIG buy back scheme will be terminated, because BIG holders will get airdropped ONEs and receive related rebate and incentives.\r\n\r\nONE is a platform token of BigONE and is not traded on other platforms.\r\n\r\nPlease be reminded that crypto assets could be highly volatile with high risks.

It is responsible for inventing proof-of-stake consensus, which makes it the first efficient and sustainable public blockchain technology. Peercoin was inspired by <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">bitcoin</a>, and it shares much of the source code and technical implementation of bitcoin. The Peercoin source code is distributed under the MIT/X11 software license. Unlike bitcoin, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/namecoin\">Namecoin</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/litecoin\">Litecoin</a>, Peercoin does not have a hard limit on the number of possible coins, but is designed to eventually attain an annual inflation rate of 1%. There is a deflationary aspect to Peercoin as the transaction fee of 0.01 PPC/kb paid to the network is destroyed. This feature, along with increased energy efficiency, aim to allow for greater long-term scalability.\r\n\r\nWith the same cryptographic hash function as Bitcoin (SHA-256), Peercoin is 100 times more energy efficient. Transactions in the Peercoin network are faster and cheaper. If there were not fierce competition on the cryptocurrency market, Peercoin would probably have long since become one of the most important cryptocurrencies. But in 2014 and 2015, however, there were many other interesting innovations in the cryptocurrency market that outperformed peercoin in a number of important properties. In contrast to DASH, Peercoin could not offer anonymity and the transactions in <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin\">Dogecoin</a> were even faster and cheaper than those of Peercoin. PoS technology ceased to be an advantage of peercoin and PoS continued to spread to other cryptocurrencies. The interest of the users drew it to the side of the minings on the CPUs and GPUs, then to the side of the Smart Contracts and PPC began to get a little forgotten. \r\n\r\nThe Peercoin Team believes that adapting blockchains for wide scale use only through on-chain transactions will negatively affect the decentralization level and security of the network over time, therefore we choose to develop the Peercoin blockchain as a base layer settlement network with a sole focus on securing all forms of value recorded into the chain. This can be accomplished through Peercoin's philosophy of preserving and maximizing decentralization (which increases security) by developing the majority of features and technologies on top of the blockchain, rather than directly into the blockchain protocol itself.\r\n\r\nThus the Peercoin Team focuses on developing second layer protocols and sub-networks that can interact with the base layer blockchain to adapt it for wide scale use and improve functionality such as tokens, smart contracts and high speed low cost transaction processing. In this way, Peercoin will act as a secure and censorship resistant base layer for the future blockchain connected world."}, "peg-eusd": {"link": "https://lybra.finance/", "description": "peUSD is the DeFi utility version of eUSD, provided by the Lybra Finance Protocol.

Initiated by a group of individuals as a tribute to the Plums internet meme that gained worldwide notoriety from the Ashley Schaeffer (Will Farrell) meme from the Eastbound and Down TV show. The currency is built on the Ethereum blockchain and is designed to be a fun and light-hearted cryptocurrency that can appeal to a wider audience beyond just Bitcoin enthusiasts. \r\n\r\nWhat are the project objectives?\r\nThe project aims to capture the growing popularity of meme coins, which have been on the rise in recent years due to their unique and often humorous marketing strategies, to serve as the safe haven for future Degen liquidity and to create a decentralized network for connecting degens through the power of memes. By leveraging the power of memes, PLUMS will create a network that is not only fun and entertaining, but also has the potential for real-world impact.\r\n\r\nWhat makes PLUMS unique?\r\nOne of the things that makes PLUMS stand out from other meme coins is that it\u2019s supply will not be centralised to individual wallets and its launch involved a $PLUMS airdrop to those who contributed to the initial LP before it reached a hard cap of 20ETH. Moreover, PLUMS has adopted PEPE\u2019s no-tax policy.

It makes use of blockchain's distributed ledger technology to provide a global trading platform for invoice financing. According to the Populous website, \"invoice finance is a form of funding that instantly unlocks the cash tied up in outstanding sales invoices. Business owners allow invoice buyers to buy invoices at a discounted rate in order to unlock their cash quicker. Once invoices are paid by the invoice debtor, the invoice buyer receives the amount previously agreed upon.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to offer funds to invoice sellers, Populous maintains a Liquidity Pool. This is tied in with the Populous cryptocurrency (PPT). An investor securitizes PPT by making an initial purchase. PPT is then held in escrow as collateral throughout the process. Transactions between invoice buyers and sellers take place with Pokens, exchanged for PPT and used as the currency for buying and selling invoices, either drawing from or contributing to the Liquidity Pool in the process. As a result of this built-in liquidity component, Populous at this point requires no transaction fees. In fact, the only fees levied are those associated with late payments. Populous invoice transactions can cover a huge array of industries, including many which are not typically available to traditional financing companies.\r\n\r\nThe PPT tokens not released during the ICO were retained by the founding and development team. PPT can either be held or used as collateral to invest in Populous invoices. In exchange for collateralizing, you\u2019re given an amount of Pokens based on a percentage of market value. Currently it\u2019s the lesser of 50%, or a 30 day market average. These are automatically used to purchase an invoice. If the invoice is repaid, you receive both your PPT investment and Pokens profit."}, "portion": {"link": "https://portion.io/", "description": "Portion is a marketplace for digital and physical art and collectibles.

Creators of the NPXS token hope that it will one day be used on their <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>-based Point-of-Sale devices. This approach could give basic banking services to underdeveloped regions like Latin America and  Indonesia. One of the most notorious pain points in crypto is the ability to actually make purchases. Pundi X cryptocurrency plans to change all that by distributing hundreds to thousands of point-of-sale smart devices to retailers so they can accept payment in the form of NPXS, the network\u2019s proprietary crypto token. If it can distribute the devices for free and with lower transaction fees than current card and mobile payment solutions provide, it\u2019s a grand-slam idea.\r\n\r\nPundi X raised $35 million during its ICO from September 2017 through January 21, 2018. 35,000,000,000 NPXS (at the time known as PXS) were sold during the ICO presale and crowd sale. The team retained 15,750,000 and another 1,750,000,000 was distributed to early investors and the rest was held by Pundi X for further development and marketing. It also set aside 2 percent of sold tokens to fund bounty programs across social media and online platforms.\r\n\r\nThe Pundi X team are a talented group of technologists and entrepreneurs, which seems to be exactly what this project will need for success. In general the management team is comprised of computer engineers turned serial entrepreneur. The glaring exception to this is CEO and founder Zac Cheah, who was formerly an HTML games developer, but perhaps this is why he surrounded himself with such a strong team. The President of Pundi X, Constantin Papadimitrou, has a long history of founding successful fintech companies, and scaling them, which makes him an ideal fit for a project that will need rapid growth and adoption. The CTO/COO Pitt Huang created and sold his first business by the age of 25 and went on to create and sell several more business, including one that had over 200 employees.\r\n\r\nThe company is working on developing a card, which they are naming the XPASS card, which will work together with the mobile app and wallet, enabling payments and deposits by card (a familiar medium for most) that are pulled from the mobile wallet. In addition, users should be able to see the current market price of each cryptocurrency before paying for goods and services, allowing them to pay with the cryptocurrency that brings the best value at the time. This ability to pay for things easily with cryptocurrencies is what will finally give them real value in a widespread sense.\r\n\r\nPundi X has taken on an impressive and ambitious task in tackling what could amount to everyday adoption of cryptocurrencies by the masses, if their vision is realized. The technology seems appropriate for what they\u2019re attempting, and the delivery of the first 500 POS devices shows that there is substance behind their efforts.\""}, "punks-comic-pow": {"link": "https://updao.app/"}, "punk-vault-nftx": {"link": "https://nftx.org/", "description": "Punk Vault is an erc-20 vault token representing NFT assets within a NFTX Vault.

Liquid is a global cryptocurrency firm looking to solve the liquidity problems that have surfaced with crypto investments. Liquid brings liquidity to the cryptocurrency space by providing a means for you to easily buy cryptocurrency with and cash-out to fiat. Currently, each crypto exchange has its own level of liquidity that differs between the trading pairs it offers. This creates individual silos that may have great liquidity on one exchange but not on another. The Liquid platform connects these silos into one combined pool to give you the greatest liquidity possible.\r\n\r\nThe Liquid World Book compiles the orders and prices from exchanges around the world into one order book for you to use. This gives any trader, no matter their location, the ability to use the fiat currency of their choice when purchasing or selling crypto. It removes the liquidity silos of separate exchanges and gives more trading power to previously underserved markets. The Prime Brokerage half of the Quoine Liquid platform basically gives you access to the features outlined in the previous World Book section. With Prime Brokerage, you have direct market access to all exchanges in the World Book without having to create an account on each individual exchange. Furthermore, Quoine has been building partnerships with a network of banks over the last several years to ensure the quick transfer of your fiat funds.\r\n\r\nQASH is an <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?asset_platform_id=279&view=market\">ERC20</a> token you use to pay for services on the Liquid platform. Beyond that, QASH holders may also receive discounts, promotional products, and ICO investment opportunities with coins that Quoine helps to launch. The team also emphasizes in their whitepaper that other organizations may use it for their own purposes similar to how some financial institutions use the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ripple\">Ripple XRP token</a>. Because Quoine enters a few different financial sectors, the company has quite a few competitors. As a credit facility, the company competes with SALT. On the exchange side, there are numerous other businesses like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance\">Binance</a> specializing in alternative coins or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/gemini\">Gemini</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/gdax\">Coinbase</a> focusing on fiat to crypto conversions. \r\n\r\n Mike Kayamori (CEO) and Mario Gomez Lozada (President and CTO) founded Quoine in 2014. Kayamori was previously a Senior Vice President at SoftBank Group and was the Chief Investment Officer of Gungho Asia. Lozada was the CTO of Merrill Lynch in Japan for 11 years before taking the Chief Information Officer role at Credit Suisse Japan. Quoine is the first cryptocurrency firm in the world to be officially licensed by the Japan Financial Services Agency (FSA).

In addition, the foundation intends to launch a Web3 platform dedicated to the RADA DAO community, where DAO members exercise authority by proposing, voting, and making pivotal decisions about the various RADA projects. The vision behind RADA is to pioneer a transformative approach in the world of sports and entertainment. The RADA Foundation has earmarked its first project, which centers on the 'Acquisition and management of a professional European FC in the lower leagues,' complemented by a football talent development initiative.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat makes your project unique?\r\n\r\nThe RADA Foundation's primary mission is to reshape the conventional landscape of the football industry, transforming it into a democratic, fan-inclusive ecosystem that transcends borders and breaks down barriers. RADA seeks to create a platform where fans are not merely spectators but vital contributors with a sense of true ownership and belonging. This is not just about changing the club operations\u2014it is about a radical transformation of what it means to be part of a football community, a vision set to create ripples throughout the sport. Moreover, the RADA talent development program offers budding footballers an unparalleled opportunity, aiming to identify and foster talented sports individuals in collaboration with professional sports academies.

Recognizing the inherent fusion of sports and technology, RADA is committed to seamlessly integrating real-world business practices with the principles of Web3.0. Moreover, we possess the expertise to identify suitable sponsors and investors for sports ventures. In today's digital landscape, the internet facilitates universal access to project information at any time and from any location. However, with the advent of Web3.0, individuals not only gain access to project details but also have the opportunity to become key stakeholders in the project itself. In this regard, RADA endeavors to facilitate the growth of European FCs by enabling blockchain and Web3.0 enthusiasts to actively contribute to the development of these football clubs. Piloting this ambitious project is a team of experts with rich, diverse experience in sports, technology, and finance. This group of professionals shares a common goal\u2014to fuse their love for football with the transformative power of Web 3.0. Adding to this already strong team is brand ambassador, David Villa, a renowned figure in the football world. As a celebrated World Cup champion, Villa's association with RADA lends the initiative both credibility and an insider's view of the football industry. His valuable insights and global reputation will undoubtedly play a significant role in driving RADA's aim to usher the football industry into the era of Web 3.0.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s next for your project?\r\n\r\nFor the predetermined project, the RADA team is developing a web3.0 platform based on the DAO community.

Moreover, the foundation aims to integrate the Explore RADA Asset (ERA) system with Etherscan for transparent fund tracking. Furthermore, a random NFT draw system will be developed based on Chainlink Verifiable Random Function (VRF) to be applied to the DAO community.\r\n\r\nIn pursuit of the first project's execution, they are conducting due diligence on European candidate Football Clubs, including Ambassadors and industry experts, with the goal of acquisition in 2024.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can your token be used for?\r\n\r\nRADA is a native token in its ecosystem. The RADA Token offers unique financial incentives, steering clear of the traditional PoW and PoS models.

Literally, every single one. The internet was stunned. \"Why?\" cried the masses. But Elon just tweeted a rocket emoji, fueling speculation and memery\r\n\r\nChapter 2: Blast off to the Red Planet\r\nA week later, a live stream from SpaceX showed Elon boarding a rocket named \"DogeStar Galactic\". The world watched in awe as he took off, not to the Moon, but to Mars. The mission? To establish the first interplanetary cryptocurrency exchange.\r\n\r\nChapter 3: The Martian Swap\r\nUpon landing, Musk unveiled a new Martian obelisk which was in fact, a token swap machine. Here, he exchanged all DOGECOIN for a shiny, new super token named \"RagingElonMarsCoin\". But what left the intergalactic community baffled was that the ticker for this new token? DOGECOIN. Confusion ensued.\r\n\r\nChapter 4: The Galactic Domination\r\nRumor had it that with every swap, the RagingElonMarsCoin gathered cosmic energy, powerful enough to control the very forces of the galaxy. It was said that whoever held the most RagingElonMarsCoin would hold the keys to the universe. Galactic domination and superpowers weren't just a dream; they were becoming a reality.\r\n\r\nChapter 5: The Rage of Musk\r\nBack on Earth, chaos reigned. Elon renamed Twitter to \"X\" (because, why not?). Elon was furious. The hate he recieved because of this decision made him think he should have named his next child X (or perhaps his next car). This rage fueled the power of the RagingElonMarsCoin even more.\r\n\r\nChapter 6: The Future is Bright (For Some)\r\nElon, with a twinkle in his eye, sent a message to Earth. Only holders of RagingElonMarsCoin would have a bright future. They would be protected from renaming shenanigans, would get premium Martian real estate, and enjoy unlimited rides on Tesla's interstellar roadsters.\r\n\r\nChapter 7: The End or The Beginning?\r\nThe world scrambled to get their hands on RagingElonMarsCoin, and as it took over the interstellar markets, one had to wonder: was this the end of Earthly currencies or just the whimsical beginning of a galactic financial renaissance led by a billionaire with a penchant for memes?

Remember folks, in crypto and in life, expect the unexpected.... road to 10bn marketcap, buy now and hodl or you are stupid\r\n\r\n\r\nTokenomics\r\nNo tax on all buys and sells...

It is an Ethereum ERC20 token that is pegged to $1 USD\u200a\u2014\u200aevery Dai is worth $1, and will always be worth $1, regardless of how much Dai is in existence. There is no centralized authority like Tether that backs its value, and no traditional bank that backs each Dai with a real US dollar. There is nothing that can be shut down, and no centralized authority that needs to be trusted. Dai lives entirely within the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts.\r\n\r\n*Features of Dai:\r\n1. Dai is always worth $1 USD each\r\n2. It can be freely traded like any other ERC20 token\r\n3. Anyone with an Ethereum wallet can own, accept, and transfer it\r\n4. It can be exchanged without any middleman\r\n5. No individual person or company has control over it\r\n6. No government or authority can shut it down\r\n\r\n*How Dai Works?\r\nDai is a masterpiece of game theory that carefully balances economic incentives in the pursuit of one goal\u200a\u2014\u200aa token that is continuously approaching the value of $1 USD.\r\n\r\nWhen Dai is worth above $1, mechanisms work to decrease the price. When Dai is worth below $1, mechanisms work to increase the price. The rational actors that take part in these mechanisms do so because they earn money anytime Dai is not perfectly worth $1. This is why Dai is always floating slightly above or below $1\u200a\u2014\u200ait is an endless wave function bouncing infinitely close to $1, but never quite achieving it. The farther Dai goes from $1, the more incentive there is to fix it. This is the magic of Dai.\r\n\r\n*How is Dai Created?\r\nDai is simply a loan against Ethereum. By using the MakerDAO dApp, advanced users can take loans out in Dai against their ETH holdings.\r\n\r\nFirst, ETH is turned into \u201cwrapped ETH\u201d (WETH), which is simply an ERC20 wrapping around ETH. This \u201ctokenizes\u201d ETH so it can be used like any other ERC20 token. Next, WETH is turned into \u201cpooled ETH\u201d (PETH), which means it joins a large pool of Ethereum that is the collateral for all Dai created. Once you have PETH, you can create a \u201ccollateralized debt position\u201d (CDP), which locks up your PETH and allows you to draw Dai against your collateral, which is PETH. As you draw out Dai, the ratio of debt in the CDP increases. There is a debt limit that sets a maximum amount of Dai you can draw against your CDP. Once you have Dai, you can spend or trade it freely like any other ERC20 token.\r\n\r\n*There are several important reasons why you would create Dai, despite the hassle:\r\n\r\n1. You need a loan, and have an asset (ETH) to use as collateral for your loan\r\n\r\n2. You believe ETH is going up in value. You can use your CDP to buy ETH on margin\u200a\u2014\u200ayou lock up your ETH in a CDP, draw Dai against it, use the Dai to buy more ETH on an exchange, and then use that ETH to further increase the size of your CDP. This can be accomplished without any third-party or centralized authority allowing you to do so\u200a\u2014\u200amargin trading can be accomplished entirely on the blockchain.\r\n\r\n3. The demand for Dai has driven the price above $1 USD. When this occurs, you can create Dai then immediately sell it on an exchange for greater than $1 USD. This is essentially free money, and is one of the mechanisms the Maker system uses to keep Dai pegged to $1 USD. Dai being worth over $1 USD encourages more Dai to be created.\r\nThese three reasons are enough to ensure that Dai is continually created."}, "saiko-the-revival": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/28932/large/200x200.png?1675499987", "rank": null, "colors": ["#65615A", "#CBB499"], "link": "https://www.therevival-saiko.com", "description": "SAIKO is an ERC20 token that aims to build an advanced blockchain solution for protecting parties in crypto ecosystem agreements. $SAIKO will build a smart automated vesting system for airdrops/payements.

Cipher, shrouded in anonymity, released the project's smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain with little fanfare. There were no pre-sales, no flashy marketing campaigns \u2013 just a single post on a cryptocurrency forum.\r\n\r\nA Humble Beginning\r\n\r\nIn the early days, Shib2 was nothing more than a curiosity. Its smart contract was simple, allowing users to exchange Ethereum for Shib2 tokens. The project lacked a clear roadmap or a well-defined purpose, leaving many in the crypto community skeptical. Yet, something about Shib2 intrigued a small group of early adopters who saw its potential.\r\n\r\nThe Power of Community\r\n\r\nWhat truly sets Shib2 apart is its community. As more people discovered the project, they formed a tight-knit group of enthusiasts. They began discussing its possibilities, proposing ideas, and volunteering their skills to help the project grow. Shib2 was no longer just Cipher's creation; it had become a collective endeavor.\r\n\r\nInnovation and Transformation\r\n\r\nThe early days of Shib2 were marked by a rapid evolution. The community, driven by a desire to make Shib2 more than just a simple token, started developing new features and use cases. They introduced decentralized applications (dApps) that utilized Shib2, ranging from decentralized exchanges to governance platforms.\r\n\r\nOne of the project's standout features was the Shib2 NFT marketplace, where artists and creators could mint and trade non-fungible tokens. This marketplace quickly gained traction and became a hub for digital artists looking to explore the blockchain space.\r\n\r\nChallenges and Growth\r\n\r\nOf course, Shib2's journey was not without its challenges. The project faced its fair share of security issues and technical hurdles. Yet, the community's resilience shone through as they collectively tackled these obstacles. Audits were conducted, developers collaborated, and improvements were made. Shib2's journey was marked by a relentless pursuit of innovation and security.\r\n\r\nShib2 Today\r\n\r\nToday, Shib2 stands as a testament to the power of community-driven projects. It has grown beyond anyone's expectations, boasting a thriving ecosystem of dApps, a robust NFT marketplace, and a dedicated community that continues to push the boundaries of what is possible in the world of blockchain technology.\r\n\r\nCipher, the enigmatic founder, still remains elusive, but their creation, Shib2, has taken on a life of its own. It has become a symbol of the potential for innovation, transformation, and unity within the cryptocurrency space.\r\n\r\n"}, "shib2-0": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/30940/large/unnamed.jpg?1689083941", "rank": null, "colors": ["#C36713", "#FEBC29"], "link": "https://shib20.vip/", "description": "What is the project about?\r\n\r\n2/2 crypto project 8000 members in telegram \r\n\r\nWhat makes your project unique?\r\n\r\nthe community is huge\r\n\r\nHistory of your project.\r\n\r\n8 days old 6m ath and currently sat at 1.5million market cap\r\nWhat\u2019s next for your project?\r\n steady growth chinese marketing, grow organically and spend money on marketing globally\r\n\r\nWhat can your token be used for?\r\nno utiltity but a very large community, solid growth, community takeover and the plan is to become the biggest memem token of 2023\r\n"}, "shibaken-finance": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/15413/large/shibak.png?1660902286", "rank": null, "colors": ["#4E4437", "#D0B05D"], "link": "https://www.shibaken.io/", "description": "\"Shibaken is a community-first decentralized finance platform; developing tokens within incentivized ecosystems of trade.\r\n\r\nFinding unique solutions to practical problems, we are experts at developing meta-level use cases for our tokens; like biodiversity protection, or securing public stakeholder interest through asset tokenization.\r\n\r\nWe specialize in serving communities requiring investments in food, energy and water security.  \r\n\r\nSHIBAK is the primary ecosystem token and is deflationary, with a unique \u201cwildfire\u201d token burn, and a 2% auto-distribution to holders.\r\n\r\nOther developments include a cross-chain bridge, yield farm, staking platform, and a swap platform to help holders of failed tokens recover their losses.\r\n\r\nOur first \"next tier\" token called Shibaken Bomb (sBOMB) introduces a simple gaming function to reward holders and automates funding for continuous development and charitable giving.\""}, "shiba-nodes": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/28890/large/output-onlinepngtools_%281%29.png?1675156319", "rank": null, "colors": ["#4B2E2F", "#A36B35"], "link": "https://shibanodes.io", "description": "As one of the Shibarium network\u2019s validators, Shiba Nodes will play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and stability of the network.\r\nWe are excited to be a part of the Shibarium network and look forward to contributing to its success.

On September 28th 1971, Shibelon sent his first electromagnetic signal into South Africa which changed the world as we know it. This signal influenced an unborn child who will carry a prodigy that will revolutionise the monetary system. On June 28th 1971, that child was born, but he wasn\u2019t a normal child, he was born a genius. And his lovely mother named him Elon Musk.\r\n\r\nShibelon then took his time to develop intergalactic travel and on August 18th 2008, he transferred a source code to planet earth and deployed a monetary online currency which is referred to as Bitcoin to see what the humans could do with it. He was thrilled when he found out that people started transacting with it as he intended and on May 22nd 2010 he saw a thread from a student in California who wanted to buy a pizza for 10,000 Bitcoins and decided to approve that transactions to help facilitate the adoption.

This paper aims to present a detailed description of the project and its vision, including the role of tokenomics, roadmap, and marketing strategy.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is a wide variety of tokens available on different chains, making it difficult to exchange and transfer tokens. ShibWallet aims to solve this problem by developing a platform that allows tokens from various chains to be transferred easily and quickly. \r\nAlso ShibWallet will also offer a secure and easy-to-use wallet that allows users to store, send and receive different types of tokens with a digital wallet that allows users to store, send and receive any type of tokens mainly from the SHIBARIUM chain.\r\nIn the context of the Shibwallet, a bridge could be used to transfer the Shib token between Ethereum and other blockchains. For example, if Shibwallet implements a Cross-Chain bridge, users could transfer their Shibarium tokens to any type of chain.\r\nBy using a bridge, users could take advantage of each blockchain. For example, Ethereum is known for its security and robustness, while Binance Smart Chain is known for its speed and low cost. By allowing the transfer of tokens between both blockchains, Shibwallet could offer users a richer and more flexible experience.\r\nIn addition, the bridge charges a fee for each transaction, as mentioned above, this could generate additional revenue for Shibwallet and potentially distribute it to Shib token holders in proportion to their stake.

At their core, options give a trader the choice to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price at a known time in the future. This is useful for protecting one's self (also known as hedging) against possible price changes in the asset, as well as speculating on these price changes.\r\n\r\nCore Protocol Mechanics\r\nSIREN uses a fully-collateralized approach to writing options that doesn\u2019t require any oracles to function. A single MarketsRegistry contract creates and coordinates individual markets. Once a Market contract is created anyone can interact with it in a permissionless manner. The solvency of a position is ensured at all times by the collateral locked in the smart contract.\r\n\r\nWith SIREN, both the long and short side of the contract are tokenized. The buyer\u2019s side (bToken) gives the holder the right to purchase or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined strike priceThe seller\u2019s/writer\u2019s side (wToken) allows the holder to withdraw the collateral (if the option was not exercised) or withdraw the exercise payment (if the option was exercised) from the contract after expiration.\r\n\r\nWhen a trader buys a put the on-chain token amount is multiplied by the strike. For example, a 1 WBTC $20K PUT will result in 20,000 bTokens. For the same reason, a put is just a reversed-assets call (e.g. a WBTC/USDC put is actually a USDC/WBTC call).\u200b\r\n\r\nTokenizing both sides of the contract allows SIREN to create secondary markets for both the long and short exposure. Under such a design in order to become a writer one purchases a wToken from the SirenSwap AMM (see below). A writer can also unwind their short exposure by selling the wToken back to the AMM. This streamlines the write-side mechanics by reducing it to essentially purchasing the underlying collateral at discount\u200a\u2014\u200aas opposed to a typical design where the writer mints long tokens and has to then sell them in order to realize the premium.\r\n\r\nSirenSwap AMM\r\nBootstrapping liquidity is core to creating a thriving market. Options are notoriously difficult when it comes to that. Not only does liquidity get fractured by combination of strike prices and expirations, it also requires sophistication on the part of liquidity providers in order to ensure fair and sustainable pricing.\r\n\r\nTo ensure liquidity on day 1 the SIREN protocol utilizes a custom SirenSwap AMM that uses a novel combination of a constant-product bonding curve and options minting to trade both bTokens and wTokens. Notably, the AMM doesn\u2019t require any asset in the pool other than bTokens/wTokens in order to trade them against the collateral asset (e.g. WBTC). This increases LP capital efficiency and provides other benefits that we\u2019ll expand on in further posts.\r\n\r\nThe SIREN core team believes that in these early days of Ethereum and DeFi less is more, so they designed SirenSwap to be a model-less market maker. This means there is no complex on-chain pricing formula nor oracle feed required in order for it to function. This makes it easy for anyone to become an LP to potentially earn trading fees."}, "sirin-labs-token": {"link": "https://www.sirinlabs.com", "description": "Sirin Labs Token is a crypto token developed by blockchain development company Sirin Labs, and is a part of the SIRIN Labs ecosystem.

The yellowpaper, which consists of more technical details on how Ethereum would work, was later published by Gavin Wood in 2014. A fundraising sale was conducted in September 2014 and the network went live in July 2015. On 15 September 2022, Ethereum transitioned from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake consensus with the Merge. \r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s Next for Ethereum\r\nNow that the Merge is over, the final stage of Ethereum 2.0 is sharding, where the database on the Ethereum blockchain is split into 64 shard chains. With sharding, each validator only needs to verify the respective shards they\u2019re responsible for, instead of verifying the entire network. This will also lower the barrier to entry for anyone who wishes to run a node. Besides encouraging further decentralization, this will improve scalability and ideally reduce the gas fees on the Ethereum network.\r\n\r\nWhat can Ether (ETH) be Used For?\r\nEther (ETH) is the native coin that powers the Ethereum network and is used to pay for transactions. ETH functions as a utility token and is used to pay for gas fees for transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, denominated in gwei. Stakers on the Ethereum network earn ETH as their reward for securing the network. ETH is also a cryptocurrency, similar to bitcoin, and can be traded on multiple centralized and decentralized exchanges, or even deposited as collateral to take out loans. \r\n\r\nTo learn more about Ethereum, please check out the following articles:"}, "snakebot": {"link": "https://snakebot.pro/", "description": "What is the project about?\r\nSnakeBot is an utility token for Telegram Bot.

Using the Solve.Care platform, businesses are able to launch networked, interoperable healthcare dApps, within only weeks or even days.  \r\n\r\nCare Networks on the Solve.Care platform use the SOLVE token, a utility token that is used for inter/intra network payments and transaction fees. It also has additional uses including developer rights, staking, marketplace payments, and platform access fees. \r\n\r\nWho is the Founder of Solve.Care?\r\n\r\nPradeep Goel, the Founder and CEO of Solve.Care, has extensive expertise in healthcare, finance and technology. Prior to Solve.Care, he had been in the CEO, COO, CIO and CTO roles at various innovative technology companies over 25 years\r\n\r\nPradeep was deeply involved in designing and building solutions for public programs such as Medicare/Medicaid, children health insurance and welfare programs, SNAP/TANF, health insurance exchanges and health information exchanges.

The SOLVE token also has a unique property of being able to function inside the Network, either as a variable value token or as a fixed value token (as a stable coin). This property makes it uniquely powerful and appropriate for healthcare usage. \r\n\r\n\r\nSolve.Care has built blockchain healthcare networks for the real-world clients such as Boehringer Ingelheim, Uber Health, Lyft, Aon, Arizona Care Network and others. \r\n\r\nSolve.Care is the first company in the world to successfully deploy digital currency and blockchain technology for value-based payments in US healthcare.

Furthermore, such a system should have deep, long-term, and protocol-owned liquidity to reduce friction and maintain tight pegs. It is our belief that creating such a system brings us one step closer to creating a more peaceful and prosperous future for mankind. The first step in building such a system is to re-think 'money' based on the following principles:\r\nOn-chain and decentralized: Reduce custodial risk. This stands in direct contrast to centralized stable coins that may have significant custodial risk.\r\nValue-stable: Frictionless trade requires using money whose value does not significantly fluctuate. Value stable is a relative term. For example, depending on the use case, the best money should be designed to be stable relative to national currencies (Such as USD or Euro), a basket of currencies, an inflation adjusted currency, in-game virtual currencies, reward points (imagine a stable coin that traces a hotel or airline point system on chain) etc. The Spice Trade platform allows building appropriate on-chain decentralized money for all these use cases.  \r\nScalable: Money is a tool of trade. The last thing a successful trade network needs is friction in scaling its monetary system. \r\nModular: As we will demonstrate in the rest of this whitepaper, the Spice Trade protocol is fully modular to accommodate both immediately predicted needs as well future unknown use cases.\r\nOpen-Source: Creating an open-source ecosystem where anyone with a good idea can contribute and build on top of the Spice Trade protocol is one of our core values\r\nCapital-Efficient: While over-collateralized on-chain stable coins pioneered the non-custodial money movement, we believe they will play a relatively smaller role in the future of money. Let us present the following hypothetical scenario in the real-world economy to demonstrate the point: Imagine we remove all the currencies in the world. Then, in order to generate any new fiat dollar (so that trade can resume), someone has to take a mortgage against their physical assets, and only then money is generated to enter the circulation. This would create such a tight monetary system that any real world economy would come to a screeching halt and collapse. And recent market trends reflects the above reasoning as well. Over-collateralized on-chain stable coins are falling further behind in market cap rankings relative to both centralized and on-chain algo-stable stable coins due to capital inefficiency.\r\nCross-Chain: History has shown that technology continuously evolves and improves upon itself. And any product, community, or nation that does not evolve with it will ultimately get left behind. As such, we strongly believe that any successful decentralized product that wants to withstand the test of time needs to be a meta concept that stays above any particular blockchain (or blockchain technology) and can easily be extended and expanded from one chain to another. For example, while Proof-of-Stake seems to be the current king of consensus-building algorithms, who knows what the future might bring. Why build a chain based on today's technology and trap your protocol in it, when we know that the blockchain of the future may look significantly different than that of today?  \r\nProtocol-Owned Liquidity based on Starfish Topology: As discussed in future sections, the Spice Trade protocol is designed to have significant liquidity with practically zero cost by building on the concept of Starfish Topology (pioneered by RadioShack: https://docs.radioshack.org/radioshack-defi/terms/disclaimer)\r\n\r\nSpice Trade is the first protocol to encapsulate all of the above principles into a suite of value-stable products.

Suterusu project CTO Dr. Huang Lin partners with cryptographers from Centre national de la recherche scientifique and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology co-authored a paper on a new efficient range proof scheme with transparent setup (accepted by a top Cryptography conference Eurocrypt 2021), which serves as the foundation of Suterusu protocol. Suterusu protocol can provide privacy protection for the users\u2019 transaction data without comprising efficiency.\r\n\r\nTo date, Suterusu network has 47 node operators and over 158k mining participates, collectively over 80% staking rate. With 3,000 Suter token reward per 60s, the network generated over 2bn suter token rewards since launch which bring the total circulating supply to 3.7bn suter token. Private round investor\u2019s token have been fully unlocked since Jan 2021, and the foundation\u2019s token will be unlocked by the end of 2022.\r\n\r\nWhat is Suter Shield?\r\nSuter Shield is a decentralized, layer-2 solution for transaction and data-protection built on Ethereum, while also can be integrated with other layer-1 projects supporting smart contracts such as Binance Smart Chain, Heco etc.\r\n\r\nIt applies public key homomorphic encryption to protect the transactional amount and conceals the identities of the sender and receiver of a transaction among other system users through invoking zero-knowledge proof. In other words, Suterusu protocol not only provides anonymity for the involved parties and but also transactional confidentiality.\r\n\r\nSuter Shield allows the sender of a transaction to arbitrarily select the target receiver of a confidential transaction without the need of sharing any secret with the receiver beforehand. Therefore, it is not only much more user-friendly, but it also provides a foundation to adapt to more sophisticated privacy-preserving DeFi functionalities such as DEX, insurance, loan, etc.\r\n\r\nIn addition, compared with other similar solution, Suter Shield not only facilitates the anonymous and confidential transactions of ETH and ERC-20 tokens, but it is also a much more modularized and universal privacy-protection solution for any smart-contract platforms, which is why we can easily transform our solutions to other platforms such as BSC or HECO. Furthermore, the Suter VM not only provides anonymous payment functionality for smart contract platforms but also anonymous BTC cross-chain functionality that will bring more liquidity to the Suter ecosystem.\r\n\r\nSuterusu\u2019s vision to provide privacy-protection for the users of all digital assets, therefore, Suterusu takes regulation compliance to its heart at the beginning of the system design. We apply blacklist and recursive blacklisting to ensure our system is regulation compliant. Any Suter transfer operation is required to compare the sender accounts of a transaction to the blacklist accounts. A transaction that involves any blacklist account will be rejected. This will guarantee the Suterusu ecosystem will effectively eradicate any misbehavior that is against the financial regulation, such as money launder.\r\n\r\nSuter token is native governance and utility token.

According to its documentation, ThreeFold allows any current or future digital workload including blockchains, IoT networks, oracles, decentralized organizations and applications, to be hosted natively on their tamper-proof and ultra-efficient decentralised infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThreeFold is driven by an open-source community of projects, stack developers, node operators, infrastructure experts and more. They focus on protecting the vision of a truly decentralized Internet infrastructure that is available, accessible and affordable to everyone, everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe ThreeFold Token (TFT) is a utility token that was designed to ensure anyone can participate in exchanging Internet and Cloud resources in the network without intermediaries. It incentivises node operators with monthly income and is used by developers to build and run workloads.\r\n\r\nLearn more about ThreeFold on their [website](https://threefold.io/). \r\n\r\nWho are the founders of ThreeFold?\r\n\r\nKristof de Spiegeleer is a co-founder and CEO at ThreeFold. After completing his masters degree in computer engineering at the university of Gent, de Spiegeleer started building the first data center in Europe with PSI Net in the mid 90s. Followingly, he founded many ventures that brought significant improvements to cloud automation and Internet storage. These were then acquired by Symantec, Verizon, Oracle, TeleNet and more. \r\n\r\nIn 2014, he started meeting other industry experts and co-founders of ThreeFold such as Adnan Fatayerji, Weynand Kuijpers, Owen Kemp and many more. Together, they decided to start from scratch and build the most decentralized Internet and Cloud infrastructure to power the web3 and web4 era. \r\n\r\nWhat makes ThreeFold Unique?\r\n\r\nThreeFold is the first blockchain-enabled infrastructure to start from scratch on the Linux Kernel. Only by doing so could they eliminate unnecessary code and backdoors that impacted efficiency and security in the current Internet and Cloud models. ThreeFold\u2019s state-of-the-art technology enables quantum security and up to 10x energy savings for storage workloads. \r\n\r\nWith solutions highlighted by a game-changing quantum-safe storage system, a next-generation docker container environment and a secure peer-to-peer network, what they created is the most comprehensive, secure and decentralized Internet and cloud infrastructure in the world. They integrated with industry-leading tools and frameworks, and anything that runs on Linux can run on ThreeFold\u2019s operating system. \r\n\r\nMore than just an Internet or Cloud project, ThreeFold represents the substrate for the decentralized Internet and cloud. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many ThreeFold Tokens are in circulation?\r\n\r\nTFT listed on Liquid exchange in June 2020 and announced a total and maximum supply of 4,000,000,000 TFT tokens. The current supply and token distribution can be tracked in [ThreeFold Library](https://library.threefold.me/info/tfgrid/#/tokens/token_overview).\r\n\r\nAccording to the documentation, 75% of the total token supply will go towards node operators and the incentivization of the ecosystem. Another 19% of TFT tokens support the continued development of the ThreeFold ecosystem and technology.

The platform allows practically unlimited external compute resources to be applied in a trusted way to extend the performance, throughput, and scalability of its host blockchain. Research began in 2015 on this verification solution which today connects blockchains to both on-chain and off-chain data while enabling smart contracts to securely perform complex computations in standard, easy-to-use programming languages at significantly reduced gas costs. \r\n\r\nUnlike sharding and other methods for distributing high transaction throughput, Truebit processes complex and large transactions via a consensus mechanism involving a minimal number of redundancies, making it a novel solution for Web 3.0 infrastructure. The bulk of computation occurs with off-chain resources.\r\n \r\nVerifier\u2019s Dilemma - What Makes Truebit Unique?\r\n \r\nRather than relying on external, cryptographic proofs of correctness, Truebit brings scalable computation to blockchains by leveraging game theory principles and financial incentives to increase the on-chain computation power of existing networks and reduce marginal gas costs.\r\n \r\nWhile smart contracts can perform small computations correctly, large computation tasks pose security risks for blockchains due to the Verifier's Dilemma. Truebit counteracts this via a retrofitting oracle that achieves correct computational results. Truebit\u2019s microeconomy ensures trustless verification through a financial incentive layer atop a dispute resolution layer.\r\n \r\nWho is the founder of Truebit (TRU)?\r\n \r\nTruebit was founded by mathematician and computer scientist Jason Teutsch who co-authored the whitepaper with Ethereum\u2019s Solidity creator and team lead, Christian Reitwiessner. Jason holds a PhD in Mathematics, was a two-time US Fulbright Fellow, and co-discovered the Verifier\u2019s Dilemma.\r\n \r\nApplications\r\n\r\nApplications include:\r\nLayer-2 settlements \r\nDeFi settlements and bookkeeping\r\nBatch verification of cryptographic signatures\r\nChecking proof-of-work\r\nPerforming operation(s) with high computational complexity\r\n \r\nAny smart contract can issue a computation task to Truebit in standard languages (C, C++, or Rust) without concern for Ethereum\u2019s gas limit. Truebit\u2019s WebAssembly-based architecture can read functions and data from Ethereum bytes, smart contract program code, or IPFS.\r\n \r\nWhat kind of token is Truebit (TRU)?\r\n \r\nThe supply of TRU tokens may fluctuate over time.  \r\n \r\nLearn more about Truebit:\r\n \r\nGetting started with Truebit on Ethereum  \r\nhttps://medium.com/truebit/getting-started-with-truebit-on-ethereum-ac1c7cdb0907\r\nAn Intro to TrueBit: A Scalable, Decentralized Computational Court   https://medium.com/@simondlr/an-intro-to-truebit-a-scalable-decentralized-computational-court-1475531400c3\r\n \r\nLearn more about Ethereum:\r\nEthereum\r\nhttps://ethereum.org/en/"}, "truefeedbackchain": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8842/large/5rd7a55q_400x400.png?1562902557", "rank": null, "colors": ["#5A5A59", "#F4CA45"], "link": "https://www.truefeedback.io/", "description": "TrueFeedBack is a survey/bounty platform where companies, institutions, academicians or other interested parties can create surveys or bounties.

While these include the Oasis and the Magna Carta Protocol, Uhive\u2019s most ambitious and sweeping goal is to share all of its wealth and success with everyone via a universal income proposal, which unconditionally distributes dividends (via tokens) for all active users on a daily basis. Simply put \u2013 success and wealth should not be distributed between only those that own equity in Uhive, but all those that participate in making Uhive a success!\r\n\r\nThe Five Core Pillars of Uhive Our continued growth owes a lot to the core fundamentals upon which Uhive was built;\r\n\r\nFreedom: It\u2019s no secret that current social networks are broken. While they might still be experiencing user-growth, that can be chalked down to a lack of a truly viable alternative. Uhive\u2019s decentralized moderation standard is the \u2018fix\u2019 millions of users are waiting for \u2013 and offers every single user the opportunity to have a voice on a platform that is decentrally moderated. Uhive aims to be 100% community moderated in 2022.\r\n\r\nDistribution of wealth (Dividends for All): Uhive\u2019s \u2018Dividends for All\u2019 revenue share model is an entirely unique value proposition and promises to share the \u2018wealth\u2019 proportionately with users. Intrinsically linked to user acquisition, token trading volume and token price, Uhive aspires to create the first global universal income for every single user!\r\n\r\nDemocratization: Uhive\u2019s has agenda has always been to give back control to the users, and in doing so democratize the entire social metaverse experience. We achieved this by launching community moderation (pioneered by Wikipedia), accepting users to become councilors, and creating a public board.\r\n\r\nCircular Economy: Uhive\u2019s economy is circular and complete, which means like the physical world, everything can be bought, sold and traded, while it operates both across the digital and physical environments. A user\u2019s content, their space (profile/s) and space names, space locations will have a value.\r\n\r\nThe Oasis (virtual world): Is our 4D immersive metaverse layer that encompasses all the above in a virtual world, acting as a bridge to our physical world.\r\n\r\nRead more about the Uhive Metaverse here... https://medium.com/uhive"}, "ulanco": {"imageUrl": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/20662/large/udacity_logo_icon_169367.png?1637545628", "rank": null, "colors": ["#1BACEA", "#98DAF5"], "link": "http://ulanco.kr/", "description": "ulanco is a P2P digital joint investment platform for real estate connecting sellers and buyers.

The information obtained from the consumers can be used by stakeholders such as the recycling industry, consumer goods manufacturers, and government bodies in charge of waste collection policies.\r\nThe WaCo project focuses on many different layers of impact, from social, ethnical, environmental and educational impact on one hand to business and revenues opportunity on the other.

Launched on June 29, 2021, the wLITI token is suitable for trading on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap, whereas the LITI token is only available through liticapital.com and requires KYC. Liti Capital uses the blockchain to manage its share registry and developing its own case management tools on the blockchain is on its roadmap.\r\n\r\nSwiss based Liti Capital creates the wLITI at a LITI token buyers request through its app on its website, which converts the LITI to a wLITI. The buyer is then able to trade the wLITI freely. Liti Capital does not directly sell the wLITI. The wLITI is wrapped at a 5000:1 ratio, and the two tokens will always maintain this ratio. The LITI is a true digital share of Liti Capital that has voting rights, pays dividends and is protected under Swiss law. The LITI is purposely not designed to be on exchanges at this time.\r\n\r\nBoth tokens represent Liti Capital, whose mantra is \u201cprivate equity for all.\u201d Liti Capital works exclusively in a single form of private equity \u2013 Litigation Finance, also called third party funding. This asset class has remained almost entirely exclusive to hedge funds and venture capitalists since its inception several decades ago. Litigation Finance is the practice of financing all or part of a legal case on behalf of a plaintiff for an agreed upon percentage of the court award. Once Liti Capital purchases a portion of ownership of a case, it provides capital that can be used in many ways: legal fees, case management and strategy, expert witnesses, intelligence work, and whatever is needed to give the plaintiff the best chance of winning the case and collecting the award. The portion owned by Liti Capital becomes a \u201clitigation asset\u201d that backs the LITI token.\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Liti Capital\u2019s wLITI Unique?\r\nBy wrapping its LITI Token, Liti Capital has given DEX retail traders a utility token that is a wrapped version of an asset backed equity token. At any time, a wLITI token holder can unwrap 5000 wLITI and exchange for 1 LITI token with KYC in place. wLITI token holders can participate in bounties and be part of class action suits against crypto cons, scams and rug pulls as spelled out in the Liti Capital Tokenomics.\r\n\r\nLiti Capital is offering a new way to get retail traders involved in this asset class, by tokenizing its equity, Liti Capital is lowering the barrier of entry for a much wider pool of potential investors. According the Laws and Business of Litigation Finance, Litigation finance funds post returns between 50-100% on average at the portfolio level. It\u2019s also a strong counter weight to the litigation spending power of wealthy defendants, it\u2019s helps ensure ethical justice.\r\n\r\nWho Are the Founders of Liti Capital?\r\n\r\nThe original idea for Liti Capital was born from its three Co-Founders, Jonas Rey, Andy Christen and Jaime Delgado. Jonas owns Athena Intelligence, a renowned Swiss Intelligence agency with a global reach in identifying assets needed for successful litigation award recovery. Andy is a data scientist and innovation entrepreneur who co-founded several startups running on the blockchain.

Using a consistent stream of dependable yield derived from rental revenue, USDR will deliver a native real yield to stakers through a daily rebase, projected to range between 10 - 20% APY. As an asset class, real estate is inflation-proof and wealth generating, making it an ideal backing for a stablecoin. While the dollar has lost over 80% of its purchasing power over the past 50 years, the price of single-family home has gone up by 14x in countries like the United States. So a real estate backed stablecoin not only works as a hedge against the volatility of crypto markets, it also protects holders from the impacts of ongoing currency debasement.

Once you vote on a proposal you can\u2019t vote on any other proposal until the next proposal period. \r\n\r\nThe voting period lasts 3 weeks and on the last week the winner is announced. On the fifth week (next month) the next voting period begins. \r\n\r\n \u2043  Staking:\r\n\r\nUsers will be able to stake $YCO at 3 different rates.\r\n\r\nFree: 3% API\r\nCoins are unlocked and can be withdrawn anytime  \r\n\r\nPartial: 30% API\r\nCoins are locked for 1 month. \r\n\r\nMaxima: 100% API\r\nCoins are locked for 3 months. \r\n\r\nThe more $YCO that gets staked the more these percentages go down once the amount of $YCO staked meets a certain threshold. \r\n\r\n \u2043 Easy transfers and payments:\r\n\r\nUsers are required to create a username on application signup and users send tokens to each other not with long complex wallet addresses but they send tokens using simple usernames somewhat like Instagram (eg: @ben) \r\n\r\nUsers do not have to pay ANY fee on the application as long as the transfer is on the Y Hub. So user to user transfers on the hub are free.\r\n\r\n \u2043 Earn:\r\n\r\n Users will be able to watch 30 second advertisements and for every advertisement earn 1 YCO. This incentivises users using the Y Hub as they are able to earn free tokens. No minimum limit is required to withdraw tokens. The second you watch an advertisement you have a \r\nY Coin in your wallet. (However depending on the future price of Y Coin this reward will  fluctuate).\r\n\r\n \u2043 Trade:\r\n\r\nUsers will be able to buy and sell  \r\nY Coin using Apple Pay or Google pay through the Y Hub application.

We at Zenland have created a smart contract platform that aims to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a middleman. We use blockchain technology to ensure the security and transparency of transactions. Our platform is designed to be user-friendly, allowing anyone to create and deploy smart contracts without needing to understand the technicalities of blockchain. What makes our project unique? What sets Zenland apart is our approach to democratizing access to smart contracts. We provide a no-code platform where users can create, deploy, and manage smart contracts for their transactions. This allows for a level of transparency and security that is often lacking in traditional peer-to-peer transactions. Additionally, we have our own utility token, ZENF, which offers various benefits to its holders and is integrated into our platform's ecosystem. History of our project.\r\n\r\nThe idea for Zenland was conceived in Q3 2021. Our team conducted research on smart contract escrow and began developing the concept. By Q4 2021, we had started designing and prototyping the MVP. The Ethereum smart contract model was implemented in Q1 2022, and by Q2 2022, we had developed the MVP and launched our official website. Our project has since undergone multiple phases of beta testing, and we minted the ZENF token in Q1 2023. What\u2019s next for our project?\r\n\r\nWe at Zenland have a roadmap that extends into Q4 2023. In Q2 2023, we plan to develop a pre-approved model, optimize Zenland for mobile, and launch the ZENF token IDO. In Q3 2023, we plan to enhance profile security and analytics, improve our platform's multichain compatibility, and update our whitepaper to version 2.0.
